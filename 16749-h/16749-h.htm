<h2>HENRIE THE FIRST, YOONGEST SONNE<br />
<span style="font-size:smaller;">TO WILLIAM THE CONQUEROUR.</span></h2>


<p style="margin-top:3em;">Henrie the yoongest sonne to William the first, brother to Rufus latelie
departed, the first of that name that ruled heere in England, &amp; for his
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;1. <br />
1100.</span>
knowledge in good literature surnamed Beauclerke, was admitted king by
the whole assent of the lords and commons, and began his reigne ouer
England the first of August, in the yeare after the creation of the
world 1067. after the birth of our Sauiour 1100. and 44. of the emperour
Henrie the fourth, Paschall the second then gouerning the s&eacute;e of Rome,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Thorne.</i> <i>Geruasius Dorobernensis.</i></span>
which was about the 51. yeare of Philip the first of that name king of
France, and in the beginning of the reigne of Edgar king of Scotland.
This king was consecrated and crowned at Westminster, the fift daie of
August, by Thomas archbishop of Yorke, and Maurice bishop of London,
bicause at that time Anselme archbishop of Canturburie was exiled. This
prince had aforehand trained the people to his humor and veine, in
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
bringing them to thinke well of him, and to conceiue a maruellous euill
opinion of his brother duke Robert, persuading them moreouer, that the
said duke was likelie to prooue a sharpe and rigorous gouernour, if he
once obteined the crowne and dominion of the land. Moreouer, he caused
to be reported for a certeine truth, that the same Robert was alreadie
created king of Jerusalem. And therefore considering that the kingdome
of Palestine (as the rumor ran) was of greater reuenues than that of
England, there was no cause why they should staie for him, who would not
willinglie leaue the greater for the lesser. By which meanes the
Nobilitie and Commons were the sooner persuaded to decline from the
election of the said Robert, and to receiue his brother Henrie for their
lawfull king, who on the other side ceased not to promise mountaines,
till his enterprise tooke effect; and then at leisure paied some of them
with molhils as by the sequele of the storie shall more at large
app&eacute;ere.</p>

<p>This Henrie therefore comming thus to the crowne, considered furthermore
with himselfe, that hereafter, when his eldest brother Robert should
returne, and vnderstand how the matter was brought about, he would
thinke himselfe to haue had much wrong, and b&eacute;ene verie euill dealt
withall, sith that as well by birthright, as also by agr&eacute;ement made with
his brother William Rufus, he ought of right to be preferred, and
therevpon would not faile but make earnest claime against him. Wherefore
yer he should come home out of the holie land (where he then remained)
the king studied by all possible
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" ></a><span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
<span class="rightnote">The king s&eacute;eketh to win the peoples fauour.</span>
meanes how to gratifie all the states
of his realme, &amp; to plant in their harts some good opinion of him. And
first of all he reformed such things as his brother had left verie
preiudiciall to the estate of the church, setting the same fr&eacute;e which
before was sore oppressed. And furthermore, somewhat to rel&eacute;eue the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i><br />
Anselme called home.<br />
<i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i><br />
William Gifford bishop of Winchester.<br />
<i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i></span>
common-wealth, he promised to restore the lawes of good king Edward, and
to abolish or amend those which by his father and brother were alreadie
ordeined to the hurt &amp; preiudice of the old ancient liberties of the
realme of England. He reuoked Anselme the archbishop of Canturburie out
of exile, who fled (as yee haue heard) to auoid the wrath of king
William. Moreouer, he placed in the see of Winchester, one William
Gifford, a graue and discr&eacute;et person, and also ordeined moonkes of
honest reputation to be abbats in certeine abbies which had beene long
void, and in the hands of William his brother: in like maner he remitted
certeine paiments which his brother and predecessour had caused to be
raised by waie of taxes and customes. Besides this, on the 8. daie of
<span class="rightnote">Rafe bishop of Durham committed to the Tower.<br />
<i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i><br />
The first ordeining of the yard measure.<br />
<i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i></span>
September, he committed Rafe bishop of Durham to the Tower of London, by
whose lewd counsell his said brother being seduced, had in his life time
doone manie oppressions to his people. He ordeined also that one length
of measuring should be vsed through this realme, which was a yard,
appointing it to be cut after the length of his owne arme. Manie other
things he redressed, to the contentation and commoditie of his subiects,
who gaue God thanks that he had in such wise deliuered them out of the
hands of cruell extortioners.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
After he had thus brought the common-wealth in so good estate, he
consulted with his Nobilitie, where he might best get him a wife, and
thereby leaue vnlawfull companie keeping with concubines: which demand
was not misliked at all. Herevpon they considered that Edgar king of
Scotland had a sister named Maud, a beautifull ladie, and of vertuous
conditions, who was a professed nunne in a religious house, to the end
she might auoid the stormes of the world, and lead hir life in more
securitie after hir fathers deceasse. This gentlewoman, notwithstanding
hir vow, was thought to be a meet bedfellow for the king: wherefore he
sent ambassadors to hir brother Edgar, requesting that he might haue hir
in mariage. But she refusing superstitiouslie at the first to breake hir
professed vow, would not heare of the offer: wherewithall king Henrie
being the more inflamed, sent new ambassadors to moue the case in more
earnest sort than before, in somuch that Edgar, vpon the declaration of
their ambassage, set the abbesse of the house (where then she abode) in
hand to persuade hir, who so effectuallie and diuerselie telling hir how
necessarie, profitable, &amp; honorable the same should be both to her
countrie and kinred, did so preuaile at the last, that the yoong ladie
granted willinglie to the mariage. Herevpon she was transported into
England, and wedded to the king, who caused the archbishop Anselme to
crowne hir queene on S. Martins daie, which fell vpon a sundaie, being
the eleuenth of Nouember.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;It should s&eacute;eme by Eadmerus, that she was neuer nunne, but onelie
veiled by hir mother, and placed amongst nunnes against hir will (as she
protested to the whole world) at such time as archbishop Anselme refused
to solemnize the mariage betwixt them, till that doubt were cleared, and
the occasion remoued, wherevpon euill disposed men would haue surmised
ilfauoredlie, and reported the worst. Howbeit whether she were
professed, or veiled onelie, loth she was to consent at the first (as
partlie ye haue heard) but after that she was coupled with the king in
mariage, she prooued a right obedient wife.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop of Vienna the popes legat.</span>
About this season the archbishop of Vienna came ouer into England with
the popes authoritie (as he pretended) to be legat ouer all Briteine,
which was strange newes vnto England, and greatlie woondered at (as
Eadmerus saith) of all men. For it had not beene heard of in England
before that time, that any person should supplie the popes roome except
<span class="rightnote">He is not receiued for legat.</span>
the archbishop of Canturburie. And so he departed as he came, for no man
receiued him as legat, neither did he exercise anie legantine
authoritie. Not long
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" ></a><span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
after, the king sent ambassadours to Rome, about a
suit which he had against the archbishop Anselme, for that he denied not
onelie to doo him homage, but also would not consecrate such bishops and
ecclesiasticall gouernours as he vndertooke to inuest. Touching which
matter no small trouble arose, as hereafter shall appeere.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1101.</span>
In the meane time, Robert the kings elder brother, returning out of the
holie land, came into Normandie: for after he had aduertisement of the
death of his brother Rufus, and that his yoonger brother was crowned
king of England, he was greatlie displeased in his mind, and meant with
all sp&eacute;ed to assaie if he might recouer it out of his hands.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i> Duke Robert chosen king of Hierusalem.</span>
&para;&nbsp;We read, that when christian princes had woone Hierusalem, they met
togither in the temple to chuse a king for the gouernement of that citie
and countrie, in which conuent duke Robert was chosen before all the
residue to be king there, by reason of a miracle (as some haue left
recorded) wrought by quenching of a taper, and the sudden kindling
thereof againe, as he held the same in his hand, standing in the church
before the altar amongst other on Easter euen: so as thereby it should
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
be thought he was appointed among all the residue to be king, and so was
nominated. But he hauing his mind more inclined to England, refused to
take the charge vpon him: wherevpon after that daie he neuer greatlie
prospered in anie businesse which he tooke in hand: as some doo gather.
Other authors of good credit, which haue written that voiage into the
holie land, make no mention of anie such matter, but declare, that
Godfraie of Bolongne was by the generall consent of all the princes and
capiteins there elected king, as in the description of that voiage more
plainelie app&eacute;ereth. But now to returne from whence I haue digressed.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote"><i>An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;2.</i></span>
When the fame was blown into England, that duke Robert was returned into
Normandie, and that the people had receiued him for their duke with
great triumph and ioy: there were diuerse which desiring innouations,
deliting in alterations, and being wearie of the quiet gouernment of
<span class="rightnote">Duke Robert is solicited to come into England to claim the
crowne.</span>
king Henrie, wrote letters into England to the duke, signifieng to him,
that if he would make hast, and come to recouer the realme out of his
brothers hands (who vsurped it by an vniust title) they would be readie
to aid him with all their power. Herewithall the duke being readie of
his owne accord to this enterprise, was not a little inflamed, and grew
more earnest to make hast about this businesse: in so much as, where he
would not s&eacute;eme at the first to est&eacute;eme greatlie of the offer made to
him by the Englishmen, who had thus written ouer vnto him (blaming
generallie all the English Nobilitie, for that while he was abroad in
the seruice of the christian common-wealth against the infidels, they
would suffer him to be in such wise defrauded of his fathers
inheritance, by his brother, through their vntruth and negligence) yet
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> <i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i></span>
although he meant to delaie the matter, and thought it rather better to
dissemble with them for a time, than to commit the successe of his
affaires and person to their inconstancie; shortlie after being set on
fire, and still incouraged by the persuasion of Rafe bishop of Durham
<span class="rightnote">In the Kal. of Februarie. <i>R.&nbsp;Houe.</i> <i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
(who by a woonderfull wilie shift, about the first of Februarie had
broken out of prison) with all speed possible he gathered an armie,
purposing out of hand to passe ouer with the same into England, and to
hazard his right by dent of sword, which was thus by plaine iniurie most
wickedlie deteined from him.</p>

<p>King Henrie in the meane time vnderstanding his meaning, assembled
likewise his power, and rigged foorth a great number of ships,
appointing them to lie in a readinesse to stop his brothers comming to
land if it might be. He himselfe, also lodged with his maine armie neere
the towne of Hastings, to giue him battell if he landed thereabouts.</p>

<p>Duke Robert also meaning to set foreward, sent certeine of his ships
before, to choose some conuenient place where he might land with his
armie: which ships by chance fell into the danger of the kings nauie,
but yet absteining from battell, they recouered
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" ></a><span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
the wind, and returned
backe to the duke, signifieng from point to point how they had sped in
this voiage. The duke as he was of a bold courage, and of so gentle a
nature that he beleeued he should win their good wils, with whom he
should haue any thing to doo, passed forward, and approching to the
<span class="rightnote">Duke Robert arriued at Portsmouth. <i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i>
<i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
kings nauie, vsed such mild persuasions, that a great part of the
souldiours which were aboord in the kings ships, submitted themselues
vnto him, by whose conduct he arriued in Portsmouth hauen, and there
landed with his host, about the begining of August. Now when he had
rested a few daies &amp; refreshed his men, he tooke the way towards
Winchester, a great number of people flocking vnto him by the way.</p>

<p>The king hauing knowledge as well of the arriuall of his enimies, as
also of the reuolting of his subiects, raised his campe, and came to
lodge neere vnto his enimies, the better to perceiue what he attempted
and purposed to doo. They were also in maner readie to haue ioined
battell, when diuerse Noble men that owght good will to both the
brethren, and abhorred in their minds so vnnaturall discord, began to
entreat for peace, which in the end they concluded vpon, conditionallie
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> <i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i></span>
that Henrie (who was borne after his father had conquered the realme of
England) should now enioy the same, yeelding and paieng yeerelie vnto
duke Robert the summe of iij. M. marks. Prouided, that whose hap of the
two it should be to suruiue or outliue, he should be the others right
and lawfull heire, by mutuall agreement. Conditionallie also, that those
English or Normans, which had taken part either with the king or the
duke, should be pardoned of all offenses that could be laid vnto them
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Thorne.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i>
<i>Geruasius Dorober.</i></span>
for the same by either of the princes. There were twelue Noble men on
either part that receiued corporall othes for performance of this
agr&eacute;ement, which being concluded vpon in this sort, duke Robert, who in
his affaires shewed himselfe more credulous than suspicious, remained
with his brother here in England till the feast of S. Michaell, and then
shewing himselfe well contented with the composition, returned into
Normandie. In the second yeare of this kings reigne, the Qu&eacute;ene was
deliuered of hir daughter Maud or Mathild, so called after hir owne
name, who afterward was empresse, of whom y&eacute;e shall heare by Gods grace
anon in this historie.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1102.</span>
The king being now rid of forren trouble, was shortlie after disquieted
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> Robert de Belesme<a name="FNanchor_3_1" id="FNanchor_3_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> earle of Shrewsburie.</span>
with the seditious attempts of Robert de Belesme earle of Shrewsburie,
sonne to Hugh before named, who fortified the castell of Bridgenorth,
and an other castell in Wales at a place called Caircoue, and furnished
the towne of Shrewsburie, with the castels of Arundell &amp; Tickehill
(which belonged to him) in most substantiall maner. Moreouer he sought
to win the fauour of the Welshmen, by whose aid he purposed to defend
himselfe against the king in such vnlawfull enterprises as he ment to
take in hand. But the king hauing an inkeling whereabout he went,
straightwaies proclaimed him a traitor, wherevpon he got such Welshmen
and Normans together as he could conuenientlie come by, with whom and
<span class="rightnote">Stafford wasted.</span>
his brother Arnold, he entered into Staffordshire, which they forraied
and wasted exc&eacute;edinglie, bringing from thence a great bootie of beasts
and cattell, with some prisoners, whom they led foorthwith into Wales,
where they kept themselues as in a place of greatest safetie.</p>

<p>The king in the meane time with all conuenient<a name="FNanchor_3_2" id="FNanchor_3_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> sp&eacute;ed raised a power,
<span class="rightnote">Arundell castell besieged.</span>
first besieging the castell of Arundell, and then planting diuerse
bastillions before it, he departed from thence, and sending the bishop
of Lincolne with part of his armie to besiege Tickehill, he himselfe
<span class="rightnote">Bridgenorth besieged.</span>
went to Bridgenorth, which he enuironed about with a mightie armie made
out of all parts of his realme: so that what with gifts, large promises,
and fearefull threatnings, at the last he allured to his side the fickle
<span class="yearnote"><i>An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;3.</i></span>
Welchmen, and in such wise wan them, that they abandoned the earle, and
tooke part against him. Wherevpon the king within 30. daies subdued all
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Shrewsburie banished the realme.</span>
the townes and castels (which he held) out of his hands, and banished
him the relme, and shortlie after confined his brother Arnold for

his
traitorous demeanour vsed against him, whereby their attempts were
brought vnto an end.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A synod of bishops. <i>Eadmerus.</i></span>
After this, at the feast of saint Michaell, Anselme archbishop of
Canturburie held a councell at Westminster, whereat were present the
archbishop of Yorke, the bishops of London, Winchester, Lincolne,
Worcester, Chester, Bath, Norwich, Rochester, and two other bishops
latlie elected by the king, namelie, Salisburie and Hereford: the bishop
of Excester was absent by reason of sicknesse.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Abbats &amp; Priors depriued.</span>
At this councell or synod, diuerse abbats and priors, both French and
English, were depriued of their promotions and benefices by Anselme,
bicause they had come vnto them otherwise than he pretended to stand
with the decr&eacute;es of the church; as the abbats of Persor, Ramsey,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
Tauestocke, Peterborow, Middleton, Burie, and Stoke, the prior of Elie,
<span class="rightnote">The cause why they wer depriued. <i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i> <i>Sim.&nbsp;Dun.</i></span>
and others. The ch&eacute;efest cause of their deposing, was, for that they had
receiued their inuestitures at the kings hands.</p>

<p>Diuerse constitutions were made by authoritie of this councell, but
namelie this one.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>The king also caused some necessarie ordinances to be deuised at this
councell, to mooue men to the leading of a good and vpright life.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">S. Bartholomewes by Smithfield founded.
Smithfield sometimes a common laiestall &amp; a place of execution.
<i>An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;3.</i></span>
About the third yeare of K. Henries reigne, the foundation of saint
Bartholomews by Smithfield was begun by Raier one of the kings musicians
(as some write) who also became the first prior thereof. In those daies
Smithfield was a place where they laid all the ordure and filth of the
citie. It was also the appointed place of execution, where felons and
other malefactors of the lawes did suffer for their misdeeds.</p>

<p>In this third yeare of king Henries reigne the qu&eacute;ene was deliuered of a
sonne called William.</p>

<p>When the earle of Shrewesburie was banished (as ye haue heard) the state
of the realme seemed to be reduced into verie good order and quietnesse:
so that king Henrie being aduanced with good successe in his affaires,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> The king bestoweth bishopriks. <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
was now in no feare of danger any maner of waie. Howbeit herein he
somewhat displeased the cleargie: for leaning vnto his princelie
authoritie, he tooke vpon him both to nominate bishops and to inuest
them into the possession of their s&eacute;es: amongst whom was one Remclid,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dunel.</i></span>
bishop of Hereford by the kings ordinance. This Remclid or Remeline did
afterwards resigne that bishoprike to the king, bicause he was pursuaded
he had greatlie offended in receiuing the same at a temporall mans
hands.</p>

<p>Trulie not onelie king Henrie here in England, but also other princes
and high potentates of the temporaltie about the same season, challenged
this right of inuesting bishops and other cleargie men, as a thing due
vnto them and their predecessors, without all prescription of time, as
they alledged, which caused no small debate betwixt them and the
spiritualtie, as in that which is written thereof at large by others may
more easilie appeere.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Anselme refuseth to consecrate the bishops inuested by the
king.</span>
Howbeit Anselme the archbishop of Canturburie more earnest in this case
than any other, would not admit nor consecrate such bishops as were
nominated and inuested by the king, making no account of their
inuestiture: and further he tooke vpon him to admonish the K. not to
violate the sacred lawes, rites and ceremonies of christian religion so
latelie decr&eacute;ed concerning those matters. But so far was the king from
giuing any eare to his admonitions, that he stood the more stiffelie in
his chalenge. And where Thomas the archbishop of Yorke was not long
<span class="rightnote">Gerard inuested archbishop of Yorke.</span>
before departed out of this transitorie life, he gaue that benefice then
void to one Gerard, a man of great wit, but (as some writers report)
more desirous of honor than was requisite for his calling, and willed
him
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" ></a><span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
in despite of Anselme to consecrate those bishops whom he had of
late inuested. This Gerard therefore obeieng his commandement, did
<span class="rightnote">W. Gifford bishop of Winchester. <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i>
<i>Wil.&nbsp;Thorne.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
consecrate them all, William Gifford bishop of Winchester excepted; who
refused to be consecrated at his hands, wherevpon he was depriued and
banished the relme. The archbishop Anselme also was quite out of fauour,
for that he ceased not to speake against the K. in reproouing him in
this behalfe, till time that the king was contented to referre the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
matter to pope Paschall, and to stand to his decree and determination:
also, that such as he had placed in any bishoprike, should haue licence
to go to Rome to plead their causes, whither he promised shortlie to
<span class="yearnote">1103. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;4.</span>
send his ambassadours, and so he did: appointing for the purpose,
<span class="rightnote">Ambassadors sent to Rome.</span>
Herbert bishop of Norwich, and Robert bishop of Lichfield, being both of
his priuie councell, and William Warlewast, of whom mention is made
before, who went on their waie and came to Rome, according to their
commission.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Anselme goeth also to Rome.</span>
After them also folowed Anselme archbishop of Canturburie, Gerard
archbishop of Yorke, &amp; William the elect of Winchester, whom the pope
receiued with a courteous kind of interteinement. But Anselme was
highlie honored aboue all the residue, whose diligence and zeale in
defense of the ordinances of the s&eacute;e of Rome, he well inough vnderstood.
The ambassadours in like maner declaring the effect of their message,
opened vnto the pope the ground of the controuersie begun betweene the
king and Anselme, &amp; with good arguments went about to prooue the kings
cause to be lawfull. Vpon the otherside, Anselme and his partakers with
contrarie reasons sought to confute the same. Wherevpon the pope
declared, that sith by the lawes of the church it was decr&eacute;ed, that the
possession of any spirituall benefice, obteined otherwise than by meanes
of a spirituall person, could not be good or allowable; from
thencefoorth, neither the king nor any other for him, should challenge
any such right to apperteine vnto them.</p>

<p>The kings ambassadours hearing this, were somwhat troubled in their
minds: wherevpon Willam Warlewast burst out and said with great
<span class="rightnote"><i>Eadmerus.</i> The saieng of Wil. Warlewast to the pope.</span>
vehemencie euen to the popes face: "Whatsoeuer is or may be spoken in
this maner to or fro, I would all that be present should well
vnderstand, that the king, my maister will not lose the inuestitures of
churches for the losse of his whole realme." Vnto which words Paschall
<span class="rightnote">The popes answer to him.</span>
himselfe replieng, said vnto him againe: "If (as thou saiest) the king
thy maister, will not forgo the inuestiture of churches for the losse of
his realme, know thou for certeine, and marke my words well, I speake it
before God, that for the ransome of his head, pope Paschall will not at
any time permit that he shall enioie them in quiet." At length by the
aduise of his councell, the pope granted the king certeine priuileges
and customes, which his predecessours had vsed and enioied: but as for
the inuestitures of bishops, he would not haue him in any wise to meddle
withall: yet did he confirme those bishops whom the king had alreadie
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
created, least the refusall should be occasion to sowe any further
discord.</p>

<p>This businesse being in this maner ordered, the ambassadours were
licenced to depart, who receiuing at the popes hands great rewards, and
Gerard the archbishop of Yorke his pall, they shortlie after returned
into England, declaring vnto the king the popes decr&eacute;e and sentence. The
king being still otherwise persuaded, and looking for other newes, was
nothing pleased with this matter. Long it was yer he would giue ouer his
claime, or y&eacute;eld to the popes iudgement, till that in processe of time,
ouercome with the earnest sute of Anselme, he granted to obeie the popes
order herein, though (as it should appeare) right sore against his will.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i></span>
In this meane time, the king had seized into his hands the possessions
of the archbishop of Canturburie, and banished Anselme, so that he
staied at Lions in France for the space of one yeare and foure moneths,
during which time there passed manie letters and messages to and fro.
The pope also wrote to king Henrie in verie courteous maner,
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" ></a><span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
<span class="rightnote">The pope writeth courteouslie to the king.</span>
exhorting
him to call Anselme home againe, and to release his claime to the
inuestitures of bishops, wherevnto he could haue no right, sith it
apperteined not to the office of any temporall magistrate: adding
furthermore, if the king would giue ouer that vngodlie and vsurped
custome, that he would shew such fr&eacute;endlie fauour in all things, as by
the sufferance of God in any wise he might be able to performe, and
further would receiue not onelie him, but also his yoong soone William
(whom latelie it had pleased God to send him by his vertuous wife queene
Maud) into his protection, so that who so euer did hurt either of them,
should be thought to hurt the holie church of Rome.</p>

<p>In one of the letters which the said pope wrote vnto Anselme (after that
the king was contented to renounce the inuestitures aforesaid) he willed
Anselme, according to the promise which he had made, to assoile as well
from sinne as from penance due for the same, both the king and his wife
queene Maud, with all such persons of honour as in this behalfe had
trauelled with the king to induce him to be agr&eacute;eable to his purpose.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1104. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;4.</span>
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Mellent.</span>
Moreouer, the earle of Mellent, and Richard de Riuers (who had
counselled the king to stand stoutlie in the matter, and not to giue
ouer his title of such inuestitures, sith his ancestors had vsed them so
long a time before his daies, by reason whereof, in renouncing his right
to the same, he should doo a thing greatlie preiudiciall to his roiall
estate and princelie maiestie) were now earnest labourers to agree the
<span class="rightnote">The K. persuaded to renounce his title to the inuestiture of
prelates. <i>Eadmerus.</i></span>
king and the pope, in so much that in the end the king was persuaded by
Anselme and them to let go his hold, resigning the inuestitures with
staffe and ring; notwithstanding that, he reserued the right of
elections, and such other roialties as otherwise apperteined to his
maiestie, so that such bishops as had doone homage to the king, were not
disabled thereby, but quietlie permitted to receiue their iurisdictions.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Duke Robert commeth into England to visit his brother.</span>
About this time Robert duke of Normandie came into England to see his
brother: who through the sugred words and sweet enterteinment of the
king, released the yeerelie tribute of 3000. markes, which he should
haue had out of the realme vpon agreement (as before ye haue heard) but
cheefelie ind&eacute;ed at the request of the queene, being instructed by hir
husband how she should deale with him that was knowne to be fr&eacute;e and
liberall, without any great consideration what he presentlie granted.</p>

<p>Now hauing b&eacute;ene here a certeine time, and solaced himselfe with his
brother and sister, he returned into Normandie, where shortlie after he
began to repent him of his follie, in being so liberall as to release
the foresaid tribute: wherevpon he menaced the king, and openlie in his
reproch said that he was craftilie circumuented by him, and fatlie
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> Factious persons practise to set the two
brethren at variance.</span>
couzened. Diuerse in Normandie desired nothing more than to set the two
brethren at square, and namelie Robert de Belesme earle of Shrewsburie,
with William earle of Mortaigne: these two were banished the realme of
England. The earle of Shrewesburie for his rebellious attempts (as
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Mortaigne.</span>
before you haue heard) and the earle of Mortaigne left the land of his
owne willfull and stubborne mind, exiling himselfe onelie vpon hatred
which he bare to the king. For being not contented with the earledome of
Mortaigne in Normandie, and the earledome of Cornewall in England, he
made sute also for the earledome of Kent, which his vncle Odo sometime
held. Now bicause he was not onelie denied of that sute, but also by
order of lawe had certeine parcels of land taken from him, which he
wrongfullie deteined, he got him into Normandie, and there made war both
against those places which the king held, and also against other that
<span class="rightnote">Richard earle of Chester.</span>
belonged to Richard earle of Chester, who was then vnder the kings
tuition and gouernement by reason of his minoritie.</p>

<p>The threatning words of duke Robert comming at the last to king Henries
eares, caused him foorthwith to conceiue verie sore displeasure against
<span class="rightnote">A power of men sent into Normandie.</span>
the duke, in so much that he sent ouer a power into Normandie, which
finding no great resistance, did much hurt in the countrie, by fetching
and carieng spoiles and preies. Againe the Normans rather
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" ></a><span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
fauoured than
sought to hinder the enterprise of king Henrie, bicause they saw how
duke Robert with his foolish prodigalitie and vndiscr&eacute;et liberalitie had
made awaie all that belonged to his estate; so that of the whole duchie
of Normandie, he had not any citie or towne of name left in his owne
possession, Roan onelie excepted, which he also would haue alienated, if
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gemeticensis.</i></span>
the citizens would haue consented to his fond motion.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1105. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;6.</span>
Now king Henrie hearing of the good successe of his men, passed ouer
<span class="rightnote">The k. passeth ouer to Normandie.
<i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Gemeticensis.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
himselfe soone after with a mightie armie, and with little adoo tooke
Eureux or (as others haue) Baieux and Caen, which cities when he had
furnished with sufficient garisons of men, he repassed the sea into
England, bicause the winter approched, and the wether waxed troublesome
for such as laie in the field. Herevpon duke Robert considering how
vnable he was (by reason that his people failed him at n&eacute;ed) to resist
king Henrie, sith the Britans also, and they of Aniou, tooke part with
the said king, he thought good to laie armour aside, and to passe ouer
into England, to entreat with him by way of brotherlie amitie, in full
<span class="yearnote">1106. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;7.</span>
hope by that meanes to auoid this present danger. But at his arriuall
here, he learned how the king his brother as then was at Northampton:
wherefore he hasted thither, and comming to him, made earnest sute for
peace, bes&eacute;eching the king in respect of brotherlie loue to grant the
same; or if it were that he regarded not the goodwill of his naturall
brother, to consider at least wise what apperteined to his accustomed
gentlenesse, and to think with himselfe that warre betwixt brethren
could not be mainteined without reproch, nor that victorie be honorable
which was obteined against his owne flesh. Wherefore he required him not
to refuse peace, freendship, and voluntarie beneuolence, sith he was now
readie to render all that euer he had into his hands.</p>

<p>The king nothing mooued herewith, but as one that disdained to make a
direct answer, murmured certeine things with himselfe, and turned away
from the duke, as one that either by experience knew his brothers light
and vnstable mind, or as one that determined to be reuenged of him euen
<span class="rightnote">The brethren depart in displeasure.</span>
to the vttermost. Duke Robert also, abhorring and vtterlie detesting
this his brothers pride, streightwaies returned home, purposing with
himselfe to the hazard of warre, sith he sawe no hope to be had in
brotherlie loue and amitie. Wherevpon he prouided for wars with all his
power, seeking aid from all places where he might get any, though the
<span class="rightnote">K. Henrie passeth into Normandie to pursue his brother.</span>
king his brother gaue him small leisure thereto, who followed him
incontinentlie with a new supplie of souldiours, desiring nothing more
than to get him within his danger.</p>

<p>Soone after, both the brethren approching neere togither, ech of them
pitched their campe within the sight of other, preparing themselues to

brother in number, first bringeth foorth his men in order of battell,
and streightwaies the duke likewise, both being readie to trie the
matter by dint of sword. Then the one prouoking the other, and the
trumpets sounding aloft, the conflict began. The kings souldiers
trusting too much in their owne force, by reason of their great
multitude, brake their arraie, and assailed their enimies on ech side
verie disorderlie: but the Normans being wiselie ordered and instructed
by their duke, kept themselues close togither: so that the kings
battell, which had without order stept foorth to assaile them, finding
sturdie resistance, began now to result or giue backe: for not onelie
duke Robert but also William earle of Mortaigne preased foreward amongst
their men, and fought valiantlie with their owne hands. Whervpon the
king, when he perceiued how his men began to shrinke, cried vpon them to
staie, and withall commanded his horssemen to breake vppon the flanks of
his enimies battell: which they did, with such violence that they
disparkled the same, and caused the enimies to scatter. Herewith also
the kings footmen, togither with the horssemen inuaded the Normans
<span class="rightnote">The Normans vanquished.</span>
afresh, who neuerthelesse resisted a while, till being compassed about
in maner on euerie side, they began to flee: as oftentimes it chanceth,
when a few driuen in sunder by a multitude, are assailed on all sides.

Duke Robert and the earle of Mortaigne fighting most manfullie in the
verie prease of enimies, were taken or (as other saie) betraied, and
deliuered into their enimies hands: beside which twaine, William
Crispine, William Ferreis, Robert Estoutuille the elder, with foure
hundreth men of armes, and to the number of 10. thousand footmen were
taken. As for the number that were slaine in this battell, there is none
that declareth the certeintie: but yet it is reported by diuers writers,
that no one battell in those daies was sorer fought, nor with greater
bloudshed either in Normandie, or elsewhere.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gemeticensis.</i></span>
Gemeticensis sheweth breefelie, that king Henrie was offended with his
brother duke Robert, for alienating the duchie of Normandie his
inheritance, &amp; for wasting his reuenues with such riotous demeanour as
he vsed, so that he left himselfe nothing but the citie of Roan, which
he had not passed to haue giuen awaie also, if the citizens would
thereto haue granted their consent. The king (I saie) taking displeasure
herewith, went ouer into Normandie, and assuming a mightie power, first
besieged Baieux, &amp; then halfe destroieng it, he tooke it by force. After
this he tooke Caen also, and then besieged a castell called Tenerchbray
perteining to the earle of Mortaigne, during which siege his brother
Robert, and the said earle of Mortaigne came with a great multitude of
people in hope to be reuenged of the king, and to chase him out of the
countrie. But the punishment of God fell so vpon them, that they were
both taken, and manie of their freends with them, as Robert de
Estoutuille, William de Crispine, and others, who were brought before
king Henrie as prisoners. &para;&nbsp;Thus did almightie God grant vnto the king a
notable victorie without bloodshed, for he lost not a man: as for his
aduersaries, there died in the field not past three score persons.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Mal.</i></span>
This s&eacute;emeth also to agree with that which Wil. Malmesburie writeth: for
he saith, that king Henrie with small adoo brought into his hands duke
Robert, who with a great troope of men came against him then lodging
n&eacute;ere the said castell of Tenerchbray. The earle of Mortaigne was also
<span class="rightnote">Robert de Belesme.</span>
taken, but the earle of Shrewsburie escaped by flight, notwithstanding
he was apprehended, as he went about to practise some priuie conspiracie
against the king. &para;&nbsp;This battell was fought (as the same Wil. Malme.
<span class="rightnote">The 27. of September chro. de Nor.</span>
affirmeth) vpon a saturdaie, being the daie of S. Michaell, In gloria,
and (as maybe thought) by the prouident iudgment of God, to the end that
Normandie should be subdued vnto England on that daie, in the which 40.
yeares passed, king William the Conquerour first set foot on land at
Hastings, when he came out of Normandie to subdue England. Neither dooth

<span class="yearnote">1107.</span>
These wars being thus finished, and the countrie set in quiet, which
through the m&eacute;ere folie of duke Robert was woonderfullie impouerished,
the king receiued the keies of all the townes and castels that belonged
either to the duke or the earle of Mortaigne, and furnished the same
with garisons to be kept for his behoofe. Hauing thus pacified the
countrie of Normandie, he came to Bec or Bechellouin, where archbishop
Anselme then remained, whome by mediation of freends he receiued to
<span class="rightnote">Anselme returneth home.</span>
fauour againe, and sending him ouer into England, immediatlie after

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Duke Robert prisoner in the castell of Cardiff.
<i>Gemeticensis.</i></span>
Duke Robert being also spoiled of his dominions, lands and liberties,
was shortlie committed to prison within the castell of Cardiff in Wales,
where he remained about the space of 26. yeares, and then died. He
gouerned the duchie of Normandie 19. yeares, he was a perfect and expert
warrior, &amp; comparable with the best capiteines that then liued, had he
b&eacute;ene somwhat more warie and circumspect in his affaires, and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
therewithall constant in his opinion. His worthie acts valiantlie and
fortunatlie atchiued against the infidels, are notified to the world by
manie and sundrie writers to his high commendation and long lasting
praise. It is said also, that he was after his taking once
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" ></a><span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
set at
libertie by king Henrie, and bound to forsweare the realme of England
and Normandie, being appointed to auoid within the space of 40. daies,
and twelue houres. But bicause he was perceiued to practise somewhat
against the king, he was eftsoones taken againe, and hauing his eies put
out, committed to prison, where finallie worne through age and gr&eacute;efe of
mind, he ended his miserable life. &para;&nbsp;The forme of banishing men out of
the realme, was ordeined by Edward the Confessor, and remained as a law
in vse till these our daies, for the benefit of them which fled to any
church or other priuiledged place, thereby to escape the punishment of
death due for their offenses. By a latter custome it was also deuised,
that they should beare a crosse in their hand, as a signe that they were
pardoned of life, for the holie place sake where they sought for
succour.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i></span>
But duke Robert (as it should appeere by that which others write) found
no such fauour, saue onlie libertie to walke abroad in the kings
forests, parks, and chases n&eacute;ere the place where he was appointed to
remaine; so that vpon a daie, as he was walking abroad, he got a horsse,
and with all post hast rode his waie, in hope to haue escaped: howbeit
his keepers being aduised thereof, followed him with hue and crie, and
at length ouertooke him in a medow, where he had laid his horsse vp to
the bellie in a quauemire. Then being brought backe, his keepers kept
him in close prison, aduertising the king of his demeanour: wherevpon he
commanded that the sight of his eies should be put out, but so, as the
balles of them should remaine unbroken, for the auoiding of a noisome
deformitie that otherwise would ensue, if the glassie tunicles should
take hurt.</p>

<p>In his returne out of the holie land, he maried one Sibell, the earle of
Conuersans sister in Puglia, hir father hight Roger or Geffrey (as some
bookes haue) and was nephue to Robert Guyshard duke of Puglia, and by
<span class="rightnote"><i>Iohn&nbsp;Pike.</i></span>
hir had issue one sonne named William afterward earle of Flanders,
whereof (God willing) more shall be said hereafter.</p>

<p>Here must I leaue duke Robert, and speake somwhat of Anselme the
archbishop, who shortlie after his returne into England, receiued
letters from pope Paschall, wherein Anselme was authorised to dispose
and order things as should s&eacute;eme to him most expedient. Now, whereas the
greater and better part of the English clergie consisted of pr&eacute;ests
sonnes, he committed to his discretion the order to dispense with them;
namelie, that such as were of commendable life and sufficient learning,
might be admitted to the ministerie, as the necessitie of time and state
of the church should require. The pope also by the same letters gaue
<span class="rightnote">Richard prior of Elie.</span>
Anselme authorise to absolue Richard the prior of Elie, vpon his
satisfaction pretermitted, and to restore him to the gouernement of the
priorie of Elie, if the king thought it conuenient.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1107.</span>
About the calends of August, in this yeare 1107, the king held a
councell of bishops, abbats, and other lords of his realme in his
pallace at London, where in the absence of Anselme, the matter touching
the inuestitures of churches, was argued vpon for the space of thr&eacute;e
daies togither, and in the end bicause the pope had granted the homages
of bishops and other prelats to the king, which his predecessor Urban
had forbidden, togither with the inuestitures; the king was contented to
consent to the popes will in forbearing the same. So that when Anselme
was come, the king in presence of him and a great multitude of his
people, granted and ordeined, that from thenceforth no bishop nor abbat
should be inuested within the realme of England, by the hand either of
the king or any laie man: on the other side it was granted againe by
Anselme, that no person elected into the prelacie, should be depriued of
his consecration for dooing his homage to the king.</p>

<p>These things thus ordred, the churches which through England had bin
long vacant, were prouided of gouernors, which were placed without any
inuestiture of staffe or ring. About this time, Anselme consecrated fiue
bishops at Canturburie in one day, archbishop
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" ></a><span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
William to the s&eacute;e of
Winchester, Roger that was the kings chancellor to Salisburie, William
Warlewast to Excester, Remaline the qu&eacute;enes chancellor to Hereford, and
one Urban to Glamorgan in Wales.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i></span>
About this season a great part of Flanders being drowned by an
exundation or breaking in of the sea, a great number of Flemings came
into England, bes&eacute;eching the king to haue some void place assigned them,
<span class="rightnote">Flemings c&#333;ming ouer into England, haue places appointed
them to inhabit.</span>
wherein they might inhabit. At the first they were appointed to the
countrie lieng on the east part of the riuer of Tw&eacute;ed: but within foure
yeres after, they were remooued into a corner by the sea side in Wales,
called Penbrokeshire, to the end they might be a defense there to the
English against the vnquiet Welshmen.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malms.</i></span>
&para;&nbsp;It should appeare by some writers, that this multitude of Flemings
consisted not of such onelie as came ouer about that time by reason
their countrie was ouerflowne with the sea (as ye haue heard) but of
other also that arriued here long before, euen in the daies of William
the Conquerour, through the freendship of the qu&eacute;ene their
countriewoman, sithens which time their number so increased, that the
realme of England was sore pestered with them: wherevpon king Henrie
deuised to place them in Penbrokeshire, as well to auoid them out of the
other parts of England, as also by their helpe to tame the bold and
presumptuous fiercenesse of the Welshmen. Which thing in those parties
they brought verie well to passe: for after they were setled there, they
valiantlie resisted their enimies, and made verie sharpe warres vpon
them, sometimes with gaine, and sometimes with losse.</p>

In the yeare 1108. Anselme held an other synod or councell, whereat in
presence of the king, and by the assent of the earles and barons of the
realme it was ordeined.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Pr&eacute;ests are sequestred fr&#333; their wiues.</span>
1 That pr&eacute;ests, deacons, and subdeacons should liue chastlie, and k&eacute;epe
no women in their houses, except such as were neere of kin to them.</p>

<p>2 That such preests, deacons, and subdeacons, as contrarie to the
inhibition of the councell holden at London, had either kept their
wiues, or married other (of whom as Eadmerus saith, there was no small
number) they should put them quite away, if they would continue still in
their pr&eacute;esthood.</p>

<p>3 That neither the same wiues should come to their houses, nor they to
the houses where their wiues dwelled: but if they had any thing to say
to them, they should take two or thr&eacute;e witnesses, and talke with them
abroad in the street.</p>

<p>4 That if any of them chanced to be accused of breaking this ordinance,
he should be driuen to purge himselfe with six sufficient witnesses of
his owne order, if he were a pr&eacute;est: if a deacon, with foure: and if a
subdeacon, with two.</p>

<p>5 That such preests as would forgo seruing at the altar, and holie order
(to remaine with their wiues) should be depriued of their benefices, and
not suffered to come within the quire.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Archdeacons and canons.</span>
6 That such as contemptuouslie kept still their wiues, and presumed to
say masse, if being called to satisfaction, they should neglect it, they
should then be excommunicated. Within compasse of which sentence all
archdeacons and prebendarie canons were comprised, both touching the
forgoing of their women, and auoiding of their companie; and also the
punishment by the censures of the church, if they transgressed the
ordinance.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Archdeacons to be sworn.</span>
7 That euerie archdeacon should be sworne, not to take any monie for

not suffer any preests, whome they knew to haue wiues, either to say
masse, or to haue any vicars. The like oth should a deane receiue.
Prouided that such archdeacons or deanes as refused this oth, should be
depriued of their roomes.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Penance.</span>
8 That pr&eacute;ests, who leauing their wiues, would be content to serue God &amp;
the altar, should be suspended from that office, by the space of fortie
daies, and be allowed to haue vicars in the meane time to serue for
them: and after, vpon performance of their inioined penance by the

In this meane time king Henrie being aduertised of the death of Philip

might happilie attempt in his new preferment to the crowne, sailed ouer
into Normandie, to see the countrie in good order, and the townes,
castels, and fortresses furnished accordinglie as the doubtfull time
required. Now after he had finished his businesse on that side, he
returned into England, where he met with ambassadours sent to him from

<span class="rightnote"><i>Eadmerus.</i> The death of Gerard archbishop of Yorke. Thomas
the kings chapleine succ&eacute;eded in that s&eacute;e.</span>
About this time Gerard archbishop of Yorke died, whom one Thomas the
kings chapleine succeeded, who for lacke of monie to furnish his
iournie, and for other causes (as in his letters of excuse, which he
wrot to Anselme it dooth appeere) could not come to Canturburie for to
be consecrated of him in so short a time as was conuenient. But Anselme
at length admonished him by letters, that without delaie he should
dispatch and come to be consecrated. And wheras Anselme vnderstood that
<span class="rightnote">The doubt of Anselme.</span>
the same Thomas was purposed to send vnto Rome for his pall, he doubted,
least if the pope should confirme him in his see by sending to him his
pall, he would happilie refuse to make vnto him profession of his due
obedience. Wherefore to preuent that matter, Anselme wrote to pope
<span class="rightnote">Anselme writeth to the Pope.</span>
Paschall, requiring him in no wise to send vnto the nominated archbishop
of Yorke his pall, till he had (according<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to the ancient customes) made
profession to him of subiection, least some troublesome contentions
might thereof arise, to the no small disquieting of the English church.
He also aduertised pope Paschall, that bicause he permitted the emperour
to inuest bishops, and did not therefore excommunicate him, king Henrie
threatened, that without doubt he would resume the inuestitures into his
hands, thinking to hold them in quiet as well as he; and therefore
besought him to consider what his wisedome had to doo therein with
sp&eacute;ed, least that building which he had well erected, should vtterlie
decaie, &amp; fall againe into irrecouerable ruine. For K. Henrie maketh
diligentlie inquirie (saith he) what order you take with the emperour.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The popes answer to Anselme.</span>
The pope receiuing and perusing these letters, wrote againe vnto Anselme
a verie freendlie answer concerning the archbishop of Yorke. And as for
suffering of the emperour to haue the inuestitures, he signified to him
that he neither did nor would suffer him to haue them: but that hauing
borne with him for a time, he now ment verie shortlie to cause him to
feele the weight of the spirituall sword of S. Peter, which alreadie he
had drawen out of the scaberd, therewith to strike if he did not the
sooner forsake his horrible errour &amp; naughtie opinion.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop of Yorke refuseth to come vnto Canturburie to
be consecrated.</span>
There was another cause also that moued Anselme to doubt of the
archbishop of Yorke his meaning, as after it appeered. For being
summoned to come and receiue his consecration at Canturburie (as
alreadie yee haue heard) through counsell of the canons Yorke he refused
so to doo: bicause they informed him that if he so did, it should be
greatlie preiudiciall to the liberties of that s&eacute;e, whose archbishop was
of like authoritie in all things vnto the archbishop of Canturburie, so
that he was bound onelie to fetch his consecration and benediction at
Canturburie, but in no wise to acknowledge anie subiection vnto that
<span class="rightnote">Looke in the 15. pa. of the debate betw&eacute;ene Thomas of Yorke<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> &amp;
Lanfranke of Canturburie.<a name="FNanchor_3_5" id="FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
s&eacute;e. &para;&nbsp;For ye must vnderstand, that there was great stomaching betwixt
the clergie of the two prouinces, Canturburie and Yorke, about the
metropolitane prerogatiue: and euer as occasion serued, and as they
thought the fauor of the prince, or opportunitie of time might aduance
their quarels, they of Yorke sticked not to vtter their gr&eacute;efes, in that
(as they tooke it) some iniurie was offered them therein.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1109.</span>
The archbishop of Yorke being thus instructed by the canons of his
church, signified to archbishop Anselme the cause why he came not at his
summons. The copie of a parcell whereof is here exemplified. "Causam,
qua differtur sacratio mea, quam nemo studiosius
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" ></a><span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
qu&agrave;m ego vellet
accellerare, qui protulerunt, non desistunt corroborare. Quamobrem, qu&agrave;m

debeo, regimen ipsius inuadere, vestra discretio nouerit. Sed &amp; qu&agrave;m
formidabile &amp; qu&agrave;m sit euitandum, sub specie benedictionis maledictionem
induere," &amp;c: that is;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The cause why my consecration is deferred, which no man liuing would
wish to be doone with more speed than I my selfe: those that haue
prolonged it, ceasse not to confirme. Wherefore how dangerous and how
dishonest it should be for me to inuade the gouernment of that church,
which I ought to rule, without c&#333;sent of the same, your discretion
rightwell vnderstandeth. Yea and how dreadful a thing it is, and how
much to be auoided to receiue a cursse, vnder colour of a blessing,"
etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Anselme hauing alreadie written twice vnto the said Thomas archbishop of
Yorke about this matter, and now receiuing this answer, could not be
quiet in mind, and therevpon taking aduice with certeine bishops whom he
called vnto him, determined to send two bishops vnto the said Thomas of
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of London deane to the archbishop of Canturburie.
The bishop of Rochester his chapleine.</span>
Yorke: and so the bishop of London (as deane to the archbishop of
Canturburie) &amp; the bishop of Rochester (as his household chapleine) were
sent to commune with him, who met them at his manour of Southwell, where
they declared to him the effect of their message: but he deferred his
answer, till a messenger which he had sent to the king (as then being in
Normandie) was returned, and so without any full answer the bishops came
backe againe.</p>

<p>Howbeit shortlie after, there came to Canturburie a messenger on the
behalfe of the archbishop of Yorke, with letters inclosed vnder the
kings seale, by the tenour whereof the king commanded Anselme, that the
consecration of the archbishop of Yorke might staie till the feast of
Easter; and if he might returne into England by that daie, he promised
(by the aduice had therein of the bishops and barons of his realme) that
he would set a direction betwixt them in all matters, whereof anie
controuersie had beene moued heretofore: or if he could not returne so
soone, he would yet take such order, that brotherlie loue &amp; concord
might remaine betwixt them. When he that brought these letters required
<span class="rightnote">A stout prelat.</span>
an answer, Anselme answered, that he would signifie his mind to the
king, and not to his maister. Immediatlie therefore as the deane of
Chichester sent ouer from Anselme, with a moonke of Bechellouin to the
king, to informe him of all the matter, and to bes&eacute;ech his maiestie, by
his authority to prouide, that no discord should rise to the diuiding of
the present state of the church of England. Furthermore, whereas he had
commanded him to grant vnto Thomas the archbishop of Yorke, a time of
respit; he should take for certeine answer, that he would rather suffer
<span class="rightnote">Anselme sendeth to the king.</span>
himselfe to be cut in peeces, than to grant so much as one hours space
on the said Thomas of Yorke, whom he knew alreadie to haue set himselfe
vniustlie against the ancient constitutions of holie fathers, and
against the Lord himselfe. The messengers declared these things to the
king, and brought word backe againe at their returne, that the king had
heard their message with fauourable mind, and promised by the power of
God, to declare to the world that he coueted vnitie, and not any
diuision in the church of England.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Anselme sick.</span>
All this while Anselme was detained with long and gr&eacute;euous sicknesse,
and yet not forgetfull of the obstinate dealing of Thomas of Yorke, he
wrote letters vnto him, by vertue whereof he suspended him from
exercising all pastorall function, till he had reformed his errour,
submitted himselfe to receiue his blessing, and acknowledged his
subiection to the church of Canturburie, as his predecessours Thomas and
Gerard had doone, and before them other ancients, as custome had
prescribed. Thus he charged him, vpon paine of cursing, except he would
renounce his archbishops dignitie: for in so dooing he did grant him
licence to vse the office and ministerie of a pr&eacute;est (which before time
he had taken vpon him) or else not.</p>

<p>In the same letters he prohibited all the bishops within the precinct of
the Ile of Britaine, that in no wise they should consecrate him, vpon
paine of cursing: and if he should chance to be consecrated by any
<span class="rightnote">Letters from Anselme.</span>
stranger, that in no wise they should (vnder the
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" ></a><span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
like paine) receiue
him for archbishop, or communicate with him in any condition. Euerie
bishop also within the whole Ile of Britaine had a copie of these leters
directed to him from Anselme vnder his seale, commanding them to behaue
themselues therein according to the contents, and as they were bound by
the subiection which they owght to the church of Canturburie. The
letters were dated alike in March.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1109. <br />

Notwithstanding all this, vpon the 21. of Aprill insuing, Anselme ended
his life in the sixteenth y&eacute;ere after his first preferment to that s&eacute;e,
being thr&eacute;escore and sixt&eacute;ene yeeres of age. He was an Italian, borne in
Piemont, n&eacute;ere to the Alpes, in a citie called Aosta, he was brought vp

to honour himselfe and his house with the title of a bishops dignitie,
procured the erection of that bishoprike, first moouing the king
therein, and after persuading with the bishop of Lincolne to grant his
good will: but yet yer the matter was brought to perfection, this prior
died, and so the said Haruie enioied the roome: wherein the prouerbe

Shortlie after the deceasse of Anselme, a Legat came from Rome, bringing
with him the pall for the archbishop of Yorke. Howbeit now that Anselme
<span class="rightnote">A legate from Rome.</span>
was dead, the said Legat wist not what to doo in the matter, bicause he
was appointed to deliuer the pall first and immediatlie vnto Anselme,
and further therein to deale (concerning the bestowing thereof) as
should s&eacute;eme good vnto him.</p>

<p>In the feast of Pentecost next insuing, the king returned from
Normandie, and held his court at London, where after the solemnitie of
that feast, he called an assemblie of the bishops, to vnderstand what
was to be doone in the matter, for the consecration of the archbishop of
Yorke. Here were the letters shewed which the archbishop Anselme had (a
little before his death) directed vnto euerie of the bishops as before
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Mellent.</span>
yee haue heard. Which when the earle of Mellent had read, and vnderstood
the effect, he asked what he was that durst receiue any such letters
without the kings assent and commandement: At length the bishops
<span class="rightnote">Samson bishop of Worcester.</span>
aduising themselues what they had to doo, required Samson bishop of
Worcester to declare his opinion, who boldlie spake these words;
"Although this man, who is elected archbishop, is my sonne, whome in
times past I begot of my wife, and therfore ought to seeke his
aduancement as nature and worldlie respects might mooue me: yet am I
more bound vnto the church of Canturburie, my mother, which hath
preferred me to this honor that I doo beare, and by the ministerie of a
bishoplike office hath made me partaker of that grace, which it hath
deserued to enioy of the Lord. Wherefore I would it should be notified
vnto you all, that I meane to obeie in euerie condition the commandement
conteined in the letters of our father Anselme concerning the matter
which you haue now in hand. For I will neuer giue mine assent, that
Thomas nominated archbishop of Yorke shall be consecrated, till he haue
professed his due and canonicall obedience touching his subiection to
<span class="rightnote">Looke in pa. 15, where you shall s&eacute;e
this matter determined.<a name="FNanchor_3_6" id="FNanchor_3_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
the church of Canturburie. For I my selfe was present when my brother
Thomas archbishop of Yorke, constreined both by ancient customes and
inuincible reasons, did professe the like subiection vnto archbishop
Lanfranke, and all his successours the archbishops of Canturburie."</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The protestations of the bishops to the king.</span>
These words thus vttered by the bishop of Worcester, all the bishops
returned togither, comming before the kings presence, boldlie confessed
that they had receiued Anselmes letters, and would not doo any thing
contrarie to the tenour of the same. Whereat the earle of Mellent shooke
the head, as though he ment to accuse them of contempt towards
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" ></a><span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
the
king. But the king himselfe vttered his mind, and said, that whatsoeuer
other men thought of the matter, he suerlie was of the like mind with
the bishops, &amp; would be loth to run in danger of Anselms cursse.
Wherefore it was determined, that the elect of Yorke should either
acknowledge his subiection to the church of Canturburie, or else forgo
his dignitie of archbishop: wherevpon in the end he came to London, and
there vpon the 28. daie of Maie was consecrated by Richard bishop of
London, as deane to the s&eacute;e of Canturburie. Then hauing the profession
or protestation of his subiection to the s&eacute;e of Canturburie deliuered
him vnder seale, he brake vp the same, and read the writing in maner and
forme following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The tenour of the profession which the archbishop of Yorke
made vnto the archbishop of Canturburie.</span>
"Ego Thomas Eboracensis ecclesi&aelig; consecrandus metropolitanus, profiteor
subiectionem &amp; canonicam obedientiam sanct&aelig; Dorobernensi ecclesi&aelig;, &amp;
eiusdem ecclesi&aelig; primati canonic&egrave; electo &amp; consecrato, &amp; successoribus

Anglorum, &amp; salua obedientia ex parte mea tenenda, quam Thomas

is;</p>

<p>"I Thomas to be consecrated metropolitane archbishop of Yorke, professe
my subiection and canonicall obedience vnto the holie church of
Canturburie, and to the primate of the same church, canonicallie elected
and consecrated, and to his successours canonicallie inthronized, sauing
the faith which I owe vnto my souereigne lord Henrie king of the
English, and sauing the obedience to be holden of my part, which Thomas
my predecessour professed on his behalfe vnto the holie church of Rome."</p>
</div>

<p>When this writing was read, the bishop of London tooke it, and deliuered
it vnto the prior of Canturburie, appointing him to k&eacute;epe the same as a
<span class="yearnote">1110.</span>
testimoniall for the time to come. Thus was Thomas the archbishop of
Yorke consecrated, being the 27. in number that had gouerned that s&eacute;e,
who when he was consecrated, the popes Legate went vnto Yorke, and there
deliuered to the same archbishop the pall, wherewith when he was
inuested, he departed and returned to Rome, as he was appointed.</p>

<p>At the feast of Christmasse next insuing, the king held his court at
London with great solemnitie. The archbishop of Yorke prepared to haue
set the crown on the king's head, and to haue soong masse afore him,
bicause the archbishops see at Canturburie was void. But the bishop of
London would not suffer it, claiming as high deane to the s&eacute;e of
Canturburie to execute that office, and so did, leading the king to the
<span class="rightnote">Strife betwixt bishops.</span>
church after the maner. Howbeit when they should come to sit downe at
dinner, there kindled a strife betwixt the said two bishops about their
places, bicause the bishop of London, for that he had beene ordeined
long before the archbishop, and therefore not onelie as deane to the see
of Canturburie, but also by reason of prioritie, pretended to haue the
vpper seat. But the king perceiuing their maner, would not heare them,
but commanded them out of his house, and get them to dinner at their
innes.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;11.</span>
About the same time the cause of the mariage of pr&eacute;ests and their
keeping of women came againe into question, so that by the kings
<span class="rightnote">Pr&eacute;ests prohibited to marrie or k&eacute;epe women.</span>
commandement, they were more streightlie forbidden the companie of women
than before in Anselmes time. For after his deceasse, diuerse of them
(as it were promising to themselues a new libertie to doo that which in
his life time they were constreined sore against their willes to
forbeare) deceiued themselues by their hastie dealing. For the king
being informed thereof, by the force of the ecclesiasticall lawes
compelled them to stand to and obeie the decree of the councell holden
at London by Anselme (as before ye haue heard) at least wise in the
sight of men. But if so it be (saieth Eadmerus) that the pr&eacute;ests attempt
to doo worsse, as it were to the condemnation and reproofe of Anselmes
dooings, let the charge light on their heads, sith euerie man shall
beare his owne burthen: for I know (saith he) that if fornicatours and
adulterers God will iudge, the abusers of their one cousins (I will not
say their owne sisters and daughters) shall not suerlie escape his
iudgement.</p>

About this season the king maried Robert his base sonne to the ladie

reuenged himselfe of the earle, and returned into England.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1112.</span>
Now, as also before, the king continued his inordinate desire of
inriching himselfe, for the fulfilling of which hungrie appetite (called
<i>Sacra</i> of the poets <i>Per antiphrasin</i>) he pinched manie so sore, that
they ceased not to speake verie ill of his dooings. He did also incurre
the misliking of verie manie people, bicause he kept still the s&eacute;e of
Canturburie in his hands, and would not bestow it, for that he found
sweetnesse in all the profits and reuenues belonging therevnto, during
<span class="rightnote">The archbishops s&eacute;e of Canturburie in the kings hand foure

the time that it remained vacant, which was the space of foure yeares,

or thereabouts. In like maner, when he was admonished to place some m&eacute;et
man in the roome, he would saie, that he was willing to bestow it, but
he tooke the longer time, for that he meant to find such a one to prefer
therto as should not be too far behind Lanfranke and Anselme in
doctrine, vertue and wisedome. And sith there was none such yet to be
found, he suffered that s&eacute;e to be void till such could be prouided. This
<span class="rightnote">The kings excuse.</span>
excuse he pretended, as though he were more carefull for the placing of
a worthie man, than of the gaine that followed during the time of the

London to that archbishoprike, who enioieng it but a while, he gaue the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Eadmerus.</i></span>
same to one Rafe then bishop of Rochester, and made him archbishop of
Canturburie, being the 35. in order that ruled that see. He was elected
at Windsor the 26. daie of Aprill, and on the 16. daie of Maie installed
at Canturburie, great preparation being made for the feast which was
holden at the same. Soone after likewise he sent for his pall to Rome,
which was brought from Paschall by one Anselme nephue vnto the late
<span class="rightnote">The popes authoritie not regarded in England.</span>
archbishop Anselme. About this time also the pope found himselfe
gr&eacute;eued, for that his authoritie was but little est&eacute;emed in England, &amp;
for that no persons were permitted to appeale to Rome in cases of
controuersie, and for that (without seeking to obteine his licence and
consent) they did k&eacute;epe their synods &amp; councels about ecclesiasticall
affaires, neither would obeie such Legats as he did send, nor come to
the conuocations which they held. In so much that one Cono the popes
Legat in France had excommunicated all the pr&eacute;ests of Normandie, bicause
they would not come to a synod which they had summoned. Wherevpon the
king being somewhat troubled, by aduice of his councell, sent the bishop

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Thurstane archbishop of Yorke.</span>
Not long after this Thomas the archbishop of Yorke died: after whom
succeeded Thurstane, a man of a loftie stomach, but yet of notable
learning, who euen at the verie first began to contend with Rafe the
archbishop of Canturburie about the title and right of the primasie. And
though the king aduised him to stand to the order which the late
archbishops of Yorke had obserued, yet he would not staie the matter,
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" ></a><span class="pagenum">[64]</span>

The Welshmen inuade the english marshes. K. Henrie entreth into Wales
with an armie.</span>
The citie of Worcester about this season was by a casuall fire almost
wholie burnt vp and consumed. Which mishap, bicause that citie ioineth
n&eacute;ere vnto Wales, was thought to be a signification of troubles to folow
by the insurrection of the Welshmen: who conceiuing hope of good speed
by their good successe in the wars held with William Rufus, began now to
inuade &amp; waste the English marshes. Whervpon king Henrie desirous to
tame their hautie stomachs (bicause it was a gr&eacute;efe to him still to be
vexed with such tumults and vprisings as they dailie procured) assembled
a mightie armie and went into Wales. Now bicause he knew the Welshmen
trusted more to the woods and mountains, than to their owne strength, he
beset all the places of their refuge with armed men, and sent into the
woods certeine bands to laie them waste, &amp; to hunt the Welsh out of
their holes. The soldiours (for their parts) n&eacute;eded no exhortation: for
remembring the losses susteined afore time at the Welshmens hands, they
shewed well by their fresh pursute, how much they desired to be
reuenged, so that the Welsh were slaine on each hand, and that in great
numbers, till the king perceiued the huge slaughter, &amp; saw that hauing
throwne away their armour and weapons, they sought to saue themselues by
flight, he commanded the souldiours to ceasse from killing, and to take
the residue that were left prisoners, if they would y&eacute;eld themselues:
which they did, and besought the king of his mercie and grace to pardon
and forgiue them.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Garisons placed in Wales by K. Henrie. <i>Floriacensis.</i>

The king thus hauing vanquished and ouercome the Welshmen, placed

and then returned to London with great triumph. Thither shortlie after
came ambassadours from the emperour, requiring the kings daughter
affianced (as before you haue heard) vnto him, and (being<a name="FNanchor_3_8" id="FNanchor_3_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> now viripotent

of the monie which was couenanted to be giuen with hir at the time of
the contract. Which when the king had leuied, with much more, towards

of his greatest p&eacute;eres to safe conduct hir vnto hir husband, who with
all conuenient speed conueied hir into Germanie, and in verie honorable
maner there deliuered hir vnto the foresaid emperour. After this, the
<span class="rightnote">The king goeth ouer into Normandie.</span>
king went into Normandie, and there created his sonne William duke of
that countrie, causing the people to sweare fealtie and obedience to
him, whereof rose a custome, that the kings of England from thencefoorth
(so long as Normandie remained in their hands) made euer their eldest
sonnes dukes of that countrie. When he had doone this with other his
businesse in Normandie, he returned into England.</p>

here in this realme, that a man might haue passed on foot ouer the sands

for a great woonder. It was also noted, that the maine riuers (which by

so shallow, that in many places men might go ouer them without danger,

<span class="rightnote">Griffin ap Rice dooth much hurt on the marshes. <i>Polydor.</i></span>
Not long after this, Griffin ap Rees tooke a great preie and bootie out
of the countries subiect to the king within the limits of Wales, and
burned the kings castels, bicause he would not restore such lands and
possessions vnto him as apperteined to his father R&eacute;es or Rice. Howbeit,
the king (notwithstanding this businesse) being not otherwise troubled
with any other warres or weightie affaires, deferred his voiage into
those quarters, and first called a councell of his lords both spirituall
and temporall at Salisburie on the nint&eacute;enth daie of March, wherein
manie things were ordeined for the wealth and quiet state of the land.
And first he sware the Nobilitie of the realme, that they should be true
to him and his sonne William after his deceasse. Secondlie, he appeased
sundrie matters then in controuersie betwixt the Nobles and great P&eacute;ers,
causing the same to be brought to an end, and the parties made freends:
the diuision betwixt the archbishops of Yorke and Canturburie (which had
long depended in triall, and could not as yet haue end) excepted. For
ambitious Thurstane would not stand to any decr&eacute;e or order therin,
except he might haue had his whole will, so that the king taking
displeasure with him for his obstinate demeanor, commanded him either to
<span class="rightnote">Thurstane refuseth to obey the kings pleasure. <i>Eadmerus.</i></span>
be conformable to the decr&eacute;e made in Lanfranks time, or else to renounce
his miter, which to doo (rather than to acknowledge any subiection to
the archbishop of Canturburie) he s&eacute;emed to be verie willing at the
first, but afterwards repented him of his speech passed in that behalfe.
Now when the councell was ended, and the king went ouer into Normandie,
he followed, trusting by some meanes to persuade the king, that he might
haue his furtherance to be consecrated, without recognizing any
obedience to the s&eacute;e of Canturburie: but the king would not heare him,
whereby the matter rested long in sute, as heereafter shall appeare.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Hereby it is plaine (as Polydor saith) how the bishops in those daies
were blinded with couetousnesse and ambition, not considering that it
was their duties to despise such worldlie pompe, as the people regard,
and that their calling required a studious endeuour for the health of
such soules as fell to their charge. Neither yet remembred they the
simplicitie of Christ, and his contempt of worldlie dignitie, when he
refused to satisfie the humor of the people, who verie desirouslie would
haue made him a king, but withdrew himselfe, and departed to a mountaine
himselfe alone. They were rather infected with the ambition of the
apostles, contending one with another for the primasie, forgetting the
vocation whereto Christ had separated them, not to rule as kings ouer
the gentiles; but to submit their necks to the yokes of obedience, as
they had Christ their maister an example and president.</p>

<hr />

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The first vse of parlements in England.</span>
&para;&nbsp;Here is to be noted, that before this time, the kings of England vsed
but seldome to call togither the states of the realme after any certeine
maner or generall kind of processe, to haue their consents in matters to
be decreed. But as the lords of the priuie councell in our time doo sit
onlie when necessitie requireth, so did they whensoeuer it pleased the
king to haue any conference with them. So that from this Henrie it may
be thought the first vse of the parlement to haue proceeded, which sith
that time hath remained in force, and is continued vnto our times,
insomuch that whatsoeuer is to be decreed touching the state of the
commonwealth and conseruation thereof, is now referred to that councell.
And furthermore, if any thing be appointed by the king or any other
person to be vsed for the wealth of the realme, it shall not yet be
receiued as law, till by authoritie of this assemblie it be established.</p>

<p>Now bicause the house should not be troubled with multitude of vnlearned
c&#333;moners, whose propertie is to vnderstand little reason, and yet to
conceiue well of their owne dooings: there was a certeine order taken,
what maner of ecclesiasticall persons, and what number and sort of
temporall men should be called vnto the same, and how they
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" ></a><span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
should be
chosen by voices of free holders, that being as atturnies for their
countries, that which they confessed or denied, should bind the residue
of the realme to receiue it as a law. This counsell is called a
parlement, by the French word, for so the Frenchmen call their publike
assemblies.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The maner of the parlement in England</span>
The maner of their consulting heere in England in their said assemblies
of parlement is on this wise. Whereas they haue to intreat of matters
touching the commoditie both of the prince and of the people, that
euerie man may haue free libertie to vtter what he thinketh, they are
appointed to sit in seuerall chambers, the king, the bishops, and lords
of the realme sit in one chamber to conferre togither by themselues; and
the commoners called knights for the shires, citizens of cities, and
burgesses of good townes in another. These choose some wise, eloquent,
and learned man to be their prolocutor or speaker (as they terme him)
who propoundeth those things vnto them that are to be talked of, and
asketh euerie mans opinion concerning the conclusion thereof. In like
sort, when any thing is agreed vpon, and decreed by them in this place
(which they call the lower house in respect of their estate) he
declareth it againe to the lords that sit in the other chamber called
the higher house, demanding likewise their iudgments touching the same.
For nothing is ratified there, except it be agreed vpon by the consent
of the more part of both those houses. Now when they haue said their
minds, and yeelded their confirmation therevnto, the finall ratification
is referred to the prince; so that if he thinke good that it shall passe
for a law, he confirmeth also by the mouth of the lord Chancelor of the
realme, who is prolocutor to the lords alwaies by the custome of that
house.</p>

<p>The same order is vsed also by the bishops and spiritualtie in their
conuocation houses. For the bishops sit in one place by themselues as in
the higher house, and the deanes, archdeacons, and other procurators of
the spiritualtie in an other, as in the lower house, whose prolocutor
declareth to the bishops what is agreed vpon by them. Then the
archbishop (by consent of the more part of them that are assembled in
both those conuocation houses) ratifieth and pronounceth their decrees
for lawes, remitting (notwithstanding) the finall ratification of them
to the temporall houses.</p>

<p>This is the order of the lawgiuing of England; and in such decrees
(established by authoritie of the prince, the lords spirituall and
temporall, and the commons of this realme thus assembled in parlement)
consisteth the whole force of our English lawes. Which decrees are
called statutes, meaning by that name, that the same should stand firme
and stable, and not be repealed without the consent of an other
parlement, and that vpon good and great consideration.</p>

<p>About this season, one Owin (whome some name prince of Wales) was
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i></span>
slaine, as Simon Dunelmen. writeth, but by whom, or in what sort, he
sheweth not. In this eight&eacute;enth yeare of king Henries reigne, on All

resisted him, and at length (by reason of a power of men which came to
him from king Henrie) in such sort vexed and annoied the
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" ></a><span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
French king,
<span class="rightnote">Foulke earle of Aniou.</span>
that he consulted with Baldwine earle of Flanders, and Foulke earle of
Aniou, by what means he might best depriue king Henrie of his duchie of
Normandie, and restore the same vnto William the sonne of duke Robert,
vnto whom of right he said it did belong.</p>

<p>Now king Henrie hauing intelligence of his whole purpose, endeauoured on
the otherside to resist his attempts, and after he had leuied a sore
tribute of his subiects, passed ouer into Normandie with a great power,
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie passeth ouer into Normandie to assist the erle of
Champaigne.</span>
and no small masse of monie, where ioining with earle Theobald, they
began to prepare for warre, purposing to follow the same euen to the
vttermost. K. Lewes in the meane time, supposing that all hope of
victorie rested in sp&eacute;edie dispatch of present affaires, determined
likewise to haue inuaded Normandie vpon the sudden. But after he
perceiued that his enimies were all in a redinesse, and verie well
prouided to resist him: he staied and drew backe a little while.
Neuerthelesse in the end he became so desirous to be dooing with king
<span class="rightnote">The French K. inuadeth Normandie.</span>
Henrie, that approching n&eacute;ere vnto the confines of Normandie, he made
manie skirmishes with the English, yet no notable exploit passed betwixt
them in that yeare.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Here will I leaue the kings of England and France skirmishing and
encountring one another, and shew something more of the contention that
was betw&eacute;ene the archbishops of Canturburie and Yorke, to the end that
their ambitious desire of worldlie honor may in some respect app&eacute;ere.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1117. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;18.</span>
About this verie time, Anselme the nephue to archbishop Anselme came
<span class="rightnote">Anselme the popes legat.</span>
againe from Rome, with fr&eacute;e authoritie to execute the office of the
popes legat in England: which seemed a thing right strange to the
English clergie. Wherefore the bishop of Canturburie, to preuent other
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Canturburie goth to Rome</span>
inconueniences likelie to insue, tooke vpon him to go vnto Rome, to
vnderstand the popes pleasure concerning the truth and certeintie of
this matter, and to require him in no wise to diminish the authoritie or
to extenuat the prerogatiue of his s&eacute;e of Canturburie, which hitherto
vsed to determine all causes rising in his prouince.</p>

<p>This said archbishop came to Rome, but finding not the pope there, he
sent messengers with letters vnto him, then lieng sicke at Beneuento,
and obteined a fauourable answer, wherewith returning towards England,
he came to the king at Roan (where he had left him at his setting foorth
forward) certifieng him how he had sped in this voiage. The forsaid
Anselme was also staid by the king at Roan, and could not be suffered to
passe ouer into England all that time, till it might be vnderstood by
the returne of the archbishop, what the popes pleasure should be further
in that matter. Shortlie after whose repaire to the king, word was
<span class="rightnote">Pope Gelasius succ&eacute;eded pope<a name="FNanchor_3_9" id="FNanchor_3_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Paschall.</span>
brought that pope Paschall was departed this life, and that Gelasius the
<span class="yearnote">1118. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;19.</span>
second was elected in his place. This Gelasius (to auoid the dangers
that might insue to him by reason of the schisme and controuersie
betwixt the s&eacute;e of Rome, and the emperour Henrie the fift) came into
France, where he liued not long, but died in the abbeie of Clugnie,
<span class="rightnote">Carlixtus the second of that name pope.</span>
after whose decease Calixtus the second was called to the papasie.</p>

<p>Thus by the chance and change of popes, the legatship of Anselme could
take no place, although his bulles permitted him without limitation or
time, not onelie to call and celebrate synods for reformation of
disorders in the church, but also for the receiuing of Peter pence to be
leuied in England (in the which point pope Paschall in his life time
thought them in England verie slacke) as by the same bulles more
largelie dooth app&eacute;ere. The archbishop of Canturburie had alreadie
staied foure or fiue yeares in the parties beyond the s&eacute;es, about the
matter in controuersie betwixt him and Thurstane archbishop of Yorke,
who was likewise gone ouer to solicit his cause. But where as at the
first he could not find the king in anie wise agr&eacute;eable to his mind, yet
when the councell should be holden at Rhemes by pope Calixt, he sued at
the leastwise for licence to go thither: but he could neither haue any
grant so to doo, till he had promised (vpon his allegiance
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" ></a><span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
which he
ought to the king) not to attempt anie thing there that might be
preiudiciall to the church of Canturburie in anie maner of wise.
Neuerthelesse, at his comming thither, he so wrought with bribes and
large gifts, that the popes court (a thing easilie doone in Rome)
fauoured his cause; yea, such was his successe, that the pope
consecrated him with his owne hands, although king Henrie had giuen
notice to him of the controuersie depending betwixt Thurstane and Rafe
the archbishop of Canturburie, requiring him in no wise either to
consecrate Thurstane himselfe, or grant licence to anie other person to
consecrate him; for if he did, surelie (for his part) he would banish
him quite out of his dominion, which should not be long vndoone. But now
to the purpose.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1119. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;20.</span>
In this meane time, the warres were busilie pursued betwixt the two
<span class="rightnote">The two kings of England &amp; France ioine battell.</span>
kings of England &amp; France, and a battell was fought betweene them, with
great slaughter on both sides for the space of nine houres. The
forewards on both parties were beaten downe and ouerthrowne; and king
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie hurt in the battell.</span>
Henrie receiued sundrie stripes on his head at the hands of one William
Crispine countie de Eureux, so as (though his helmet were verie strong
and sure) the blood burst out of his mouth: wherewith he was nothing
afraid, but like a fierce lion laid more lustilie about him, and stroke
downe diuerse of his enimies, namelie the said Crispine, who was there
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Eureux taken prisoner.</span>
taken prisoner at the kings feet. Now were the kings people incouraged
at the valiancie and prowesse of their king and chieftaine, so that at
length they opened and ouercame the maine battell, and setting vpon the
rereward, ouerthrew the whole armie of France, which neuer recoiled, but
fought it out euen to the vttermost. There died and were taken prisoners
in this conflict manie thousands of men. The French king leauing the
<span class="rightnote">Andelei.<br />
Nicasium.</span>
field, got him vnto a place called Andelie: and the king of England
recouering a towne by the waie called Nicasium, which the French king
had latelie woone, returned vnto Rouen, where he was with great triumph
receiued, and highlie commended for his noble victorie thus atchiued.</p>

<p>The earle of Flanders (as some write) was so wounded in this battell,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Ia.&nbsp;Meir.</i></span>
that he died thereof. But others affirme, that c&#333;ming into Normandie
in the yeare last past, to make warre against king Henrie in fauour of
king Lewes, he wan the towne of Andelie, and an other which they name
Aqu&aelig; Nicasij. But as he was come before the towne of Augen in the moneth
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Flanders wounded. He departed this life.</span>
of September, and assailed the same, he receiued his deaths wound in the
head, wherevpon returning home in the ninth moneth after, when he could
not be cured of his hurt, he departed this life at Rosilare the 17. daie
of June.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Foulke earle of Aniou became the king of Englands man.</span>
Shortlie after Foulke earle of Aniou (who before had aided the French
king against king Henrie) became now king Henries freend by aliance,
marieng his daughter to William king Henries eldest sonne. But the
French king (as their histories make mention) minding still to be
reuenged of the earle Theobald, inuaded his countrie againe with a
puissant armie, and had destroied the citie of Chartres, which belonged
vnto the same earle, had not the citizens humbled themselues to his
mercie: and so likewise did the earle, as may be thought. For in the
warres which immediatlie followed betwixt Lewes and the emperour Henrie,
the erle aided the French king against the same emperour to<a name="FNanchor_3_10" id="FNanchor_3_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the
<span class="rightnote">The king and the pope come to an enteruew at Gisors.</span>
vttermost of his power. Soone after this, the king came to an enteruiew
with pope Calixtus at Gisors, where manie matters were talked of betwixt
them: and amongst other, the king required of the pope a grant of all
such liberties as his father enioied within the limits of England and
Normandie, and ch&eacute;efelie that no legat should haue any thing to doo
within England, except he required to haue one sent him for some vrgent
cause.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The pope is a suiter for Thurstane</span>
All which matters being determined (as the state of the time present
required) the pope besought the king to be good vnto archbishop
Thurstane, and to restore him to his s&eacute;e: but the king protested that he
had vowed neuer so to doo whilest he liued. Wherevnto the pope answered,
<span class="rightnote">The pope offereth to discharge the K. of his vow.</span>
that he was pope, and by his apostolike power he would discharge him of
that vow, if he would satisfie his request. The king to shift the matter
off,
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" ></a><span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
promised the pope that he would take aduice of his councell, and
giue him further knowledge, as the cause required, wherevpon departing
<span class="rightnote"><i>Eadmerus.</i> The kings answer sent to the pope.</span>
from thense, he did afterwards (vpon farther deliberation) send him this
message, in effect as followeth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Whereas he saith he is pope, and will (as he said) assoile me of the
vow which I haue made, if contrarie thereto I will restore Thurstane to
the s&eacute;e of Yorke: I thinke it not to stand with the honor of a king, to
consent in any wise vnto such an absolution. For who shall bel&eacute;eue an
others promise hereafter, if by mine example he s&eacute;e the same so easilie
by an absolution to be made void. But sith he hath so great a desire to
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Eadmerus.</i></span>
haue Thurstane restored, I shall be contented at his request, to receiue
him to his s&eacute;e, with this condition, that he shall acknowledge his
church to be subiect vnto the s&eacute;e of Canturburie, as his predecessours
haue doone before him; although in fine this offer would not serue the
turne."</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1120. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;21.</span>
But now to returne againe to the two princes. Not long after the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i></span>
departure of the pope from Gisors, Foulke earle of Aniou found meanes to
make an agreement betwixt king Henrie &amp; king Lewes, so that king William
<span class="rightnote">The kings of England and France are accorded. <i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i>
<i>Eadmerus.</i></span>
sonne to king Henrie did homage vnto king Lewes for the duchie of
Normandie. And further it was accorded betw&eacute;ene them, that all those
that had borne armour either on the one side or the other, should be
pardoned, whose subiects<a name="FNanchor_3_11" id="FNanchor_3_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> soeuer they were. In like maner, Rafe
archbishop of Canturburie returned into England, after he had remained
long in Normandie, bicause of the controuersie betwixt him and Thurstan
archbishop of Yorke, as is aforesaid.</p>

<p>Now shortlie after his returne to Canturburie, messengers came with
letters from Alexander king of Scotland vnto him, signifieng, that where
<span class="rightnote">Alexander K. of Scots.</span>
the s&eacute;e of S. Andrews was void, the same king did instantlie require him
to send ouer Eadmer a moonke of Canturburie (of whom he had heard great
commendation for his sufficiencie of vertue and learning) to be seated
there. &para;&nbsp;This Eadmer is the same which wrote the historie intituled
Historia nouorum in Anglia, out of which (as may appeare) we haue
gathered the most part of our matters concerning Anselme and Rafe
<span class="rightnote">Eadmer Anselmes disciple.</span>
archbishops of Canturburie, in whose daies he liued, and was Anselmes
disciple.</p>

<p>Archbishop Rafe was contented to satisfie the request of king Alexander
in that behalfe, and obteining the consent of king Henrie, he sent the
said Eadmer into Scotland with letters of commendation vnto the said
king Alexander, who receiued him right ioifullie, and vpon the third
daie after his comming thither (being the feast of the apostles Peter &amp;
Paule) he was elected archbishop of S. Andrews by the clergie and people
of the land, to the great reioicing of Alexander, and the rest of the
Nobilitie. The next daie after the king talked with him secretlie of his
consecration, and vttered to him how he had no mind to haue him
consecrated at the hands of Thurstan archbishop of Yorke. In which case
when he was informed by the said Eadmer, that no such thing needed to
trouble his mind, since the archbishop of Canturburie, being primate of
all Britaine, might consecrate him as reason was; the king could not
away with that answer, bicause he would not heare that the church of
Canturburie should be preferred before the church of S. Andrews.
Herevpon he departed from Eadmer in displeasure, and calling one William
(sometime moonke of S. Edmundsbury) vnto him, a man also that had
gouerned (or rather spoiled) the church of S. Andrews in the vacation:
this William was commanded to take vpon him the charge thereof againe,
at the kings pleasure, whose meaning was vtterlie to remooue Eadmer, as
not worthie of that roome. Howbeit, within a moneth after (to satisfie
the minds of his Nobles) he called for the said Eadmer, and with much
<span class="rightnote">Eadmer receiueth his staffe from an altar.</span>
adoo got him to receiue the staffe of that bishoprike, taking it from an
altar whereon it laie (as if he shuld haue that dignitie at the Lords
hands) whereby he was inuested, &amp; went streight to S. Andrews church,
where he was receiued by the quier, the schollers, and all the people,
for true and lawfull bishop.</p>

<p>In this meane while Thurstan nothing slacking his sute in the popes
court, obteined such fauour (wherein the king of England also was
greatlie laboured vnto) that he wrote
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" ></a><span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
letters thrice vnto the king of
Scotland, and once vnto the archbishop of Canturburie, that neither the
king should permit Eadmer to be consecrated, nor the archbishop of
Canturburie in any wise consecrate him if he were therevnto required.
Herevpon it came to passe, that finally Eadmer, after he had remained in
Scotland twelue moneths or thereabouts, and perceiued that things went
not as he would haue wished (for that he could not get the kings consent
that he shuld be consecrated of the archbishop of Canturburie, as it was
first meant both by the archbishop and Eadmer) he departed out of
Scotland, and returned againe to Canturburie, there to take further
aduice in all things as cause should mooue him. In like maner king
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie returneth into England.<br />
<i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i>
<i>Polydor.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i><br />
The kings sonnes and his daughter with other
Nobles are drowned by shipwracke.</span>
Henrie, hauing quieted his businesse in France, returned into England,
where he was receiued and welcomed home with great ioy and triumph; but
such publike reioising lasted not long with him. For ind&eacute;ed, this
pleasantnesse and mirth was changed into mourning, by aduertisement
giuen of the death of the kings sons, William duke of Normandie, and
Richard his brother, who togither with their sister the ladie Marie
countesse of Perch, Richard earle of Chester, with his brother Otwell
gouernour to duke William, and the said earle of Chester his wife the
kings neece, the archdeacon of Hereford, Geffrey Riddle, Robert Manduit,
William Bigot, and diuerse other, to the number of an hundreth and
fourtie persons, besides fiftie mariners, tooke ship at Harflew,
thinking to follow the king, and sailing foorth with a south wind, their
ship thorough negligence of the mariners (who had drunke out their wits
&amp; reason) were throwne vpon a rocke, and vtterlie perished on the coast
of England, vpon the 25. of Nouember, so that of all the companie none
escaped but one butcher, who catching hold of the mast, was driuen with
the same to the shore which was at hand, and so saued from that
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i></span>
dangerous shipwracke. Duke William might also haue escaped verie well,
if pitie had not mooued him more than the regard of his owne
preseruation. For being gotten into the shipboat, and lanching toward
the land, he heard the skr&eacute;eking of his sister in dredfull danger of
drowning, and crieng out for succour; wherevpon he commanded them that
rowed the boat to turne backe to the ship, and to take hir in. But such
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
was the prease of the companie that stroue to leape in with her, that it
streightwaies sanke, so that all those which were alreadie in the boat
were cast awaie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Looke in page 39.<a name="FNanchor_3_13" id="FNanchor_3_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>
&para;&nbsp;Here (by the way) would be noted the vnaduised speech of William Rufus
to the shipmaister, whom he emboldened with a vaine and desperat
persuasion in tempestuous weather and high seas to hoise vp sailes;
adding (for further encouragement) that he neuer heard of any king that
was drowned. In which words (no doubt) he sinned presumptuouslie against
God, who in due time punished that offense of his in his posteritie and
kinred, euen by the same element, whose fearsenes he himselfe s&eacute;emed so
little to regard, as if he would haue commanded the stormes to cease; as
we read Christ did in the gospell by the vertue and power of his word.
Here is also to be noted the variablenes of fortune (as we commonlie
call it) or rather the vncerteine and changeable euent of things, which
oftentimes dooth raise vp (euen in the<a name="FNanchor_3_12" id="FNanchor_3_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_12" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> minds of princes) troblesome
thoughts, and gr&eacute;euous passions, to the great empairing of their
quietnesse: as here we s&eacute;e exemplified in king Henrie, whose mirth was
turned into mone, and his pleasures relished with pangs of pensifenes,
contrarie to his expectation when he was in the midst of his triumph at
his returne out of France into England. So that we see the old adage
verified, Miscentur tristia l&aelig;tis; and that saieng of an old poet
iustified;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"  style="margin-top: 1em;">

<p>

But to returne to the historie. King Henrie being thus depriued of issue
to succeed him, did not a little lament that infortunate chance: but yet
to restore that losse, shortlie after, euen the 10. of Aprill next
ensuing, he maried his second wife named Adelicia, a ladie of excellent
<span class="rightnote"><i>Eadmerus.</i> <i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i> The king marieth againe.</span>
beautie, and noble conditions, daughter to the duke of Louaine, and
descended of the noble dukes of Loraine, howbeit he could neuer haue any
issue by hir.
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" ></a><span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
The archbishop Thurstan (after the manner of obteining
suites in the court of Rome) found such fauour at the hands of pope
Calixt,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Eadmerus.</i> The pope writeth to king Henrie, in fauour of the
archbishop Thurstan, &amp; accurseth him with the archbishop of
Canturburie.</span>
that he directed his letters as well to king Henrie, as to Rafe
archbishop of Canturburie, by vertue whereof he accursed them both, and
interdicted as well the prouince of Yorke as Canturburie from the vse of
all maner of sacraments: from baptisme of infants, the penance of them
that died onelie excepted: if archbishop Thurstan were not suffered
(within one moneth next after the receipt of those letters) to inioie
his see, without compelling him to make any promise of subiection at
all. The king to be out of trouble, permitted Thurstan to returne into
the realme, and so repaire vnto Yorke; but with condition, that he
should not exercise any iurisdiction out of his owne diocesse as
metropolitane, till he had confessed his obstinat errour, and
acknowleged his obedience to the church of Canturburie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The Welshmen make sturres.<br />
<i>Eadmerus.</i><br />
The king raiseth an
armie to go against the Welshmen.</span>
Whilest these things were thus a dooing, king Henrie was aduertised,
that the Welshmen breaking the peace, did much hurt on the marshes, &amp;
speciallie in Cheshire where they had burned two castells. Meaning
therefore to be reuenged on them to the vttermost, he assembled an armie
out of all parts of his realme, and entred with the same into Wales. The
Welshmen, hearing that the king was come with such puissance to inuade
them, were afraid, and forthwith sent ambassadours, bes&eacute;eching him to
grant them pardon and peace. The king mooued with their humble
<span class="rightnote">The Welshmen sue for peace.</span>
petitions, tooke hostages of them, &amp; remitted them for that time,
considering that in mainteining of warre against such maner of people,
there was more feare of losse than hope of gaine. But yet to prouide for
the quietnes of his subiects which inhabited n&eacute;ere the marshes, that
<span class="rightnote">More doubt of losse than hope of gaine, by the warres against
the Welshmen.</span>
they shuld not be ouerrun and harried dailie by them (as oftentimes
before they had b&eacute;ene) he appointed Warren earle of Shrewesburie to haue
the charge of the marshes, that peace might be the better kept and
mainteined in the countrie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i>
A chanell cast from Torksey to Lincolne.<br />

Soone after king Henrie caused a chanell to be cast along the countrie
in Lincolnshire, from Torksey to the citie of Lincolne, that vessels
might haue passage out of the riuer of Trent vnto the same. Moreouer,
Rafe bishop of Durham began to build the castell of
Norham, vpon the
bank of the riuer of Tw&eacute;ed.</p>

<p>At this time likewise Foulke Earle of Aniou being now come out of the
holie land (whither he went after the peace was made betwixt king Henrie
and the French king) began to picke a quarrell against king Henrie, for
withholding the iointure of his daughter, who (as before you haue heard)
was married vnto William the kings sonne that was drowned. He also gaue
hir sister in mariage vnto William the sonne of duke Robert, assigning
vnto him the earledome of Maime to enioy in the right of his wife.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
In the meane time, king Henrie visited the north parts of his realme, to
vnderstand the state of the countrie, and to prouide for the suertie and
good gouernement thereof, as was thought requisite.</p>

<span class="rightnote">13. Kalends of Nouember.</span>
In the yeare next ensuing, the twentith of October, Rafe archbishop of
Canturburie departed this life, after he had ruled that see the space of
8. yeares, in whose roome succ&eacute;eded one William archbishop, who was in
number the eight and twentith from Augustine. Moreouer, Henrie the sonne
of earle Blois, who before was abbat of Glastenburie, was now made
bishop of Winchester, a man for his singular bountie, gentlenesse and
modestie greatlie beloued of the English.</p>

<p>But to returne to the affaires of the king. It chanced about this time,
that the parts beyond the sea (being<a name="FNanchor_3_14" id="FNanchor_3_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> now void of a gouernour (as they
suppose) by meanes of the death of the kings sonne) began to make
<span class="yearnote">1123. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;24.</span>
commotions. Soone after it came also to passe that Robert earle of

Mellent rebelled against the king, who being sp&eacute;edilie aduertised
thereof, sailed foorthwith into those quarters, and besieged the castell
of Ponteaudemer perteining to the said earle, and tooke it. About the
same time also the king fortified the castell of Roan, causing a mightie
thick wall with turrets thereabout as a fortification to be made.
Likewise, he repaired the castell of Caen, the castels of Arches,
Gisors,
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" ></a><span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
Faleise, Argentone, Damfront, Vernon, Ambres, with others, &amp;
<span class="yearnote">1124. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;25.</span>
made them strong. In the meane season, the earle of Mellent (desirous to
be reuenged of king Henrie) procured aid where he could, and so with
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> <i>H.&nbsp;Hunt.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
Hugh earle of Mountfert entred into Normandie, wasting and destroieng
the countrie with fire and sword, thinking yer long to bring the same to
obedience. But the kings chamberlaine and lieutenant in those parts,
named William de Tankeruile, being thereof aduertised, laid an ambush
for them, and training them within the danger thereof, set vpon them,
and after long fight, tooke them twaine prisoners, with diuers other,
and presented them both vnto the king, whereby the warres ceassed in
that countrie for a time.</p>

<p>The king hauing in this maner purchased quietnesse by the sword, gaue
himselfe somewhat to the reformation of his house, and among other
things which he redressed, he caused all his knights and men of warre to
<span class="rightnote">Long haire redressed in the court. <i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i></span>
cut their haire short, after the maner of the Frenchmen, whereas before
they ware the same long after the vsage of women.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1125. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;26.</span>
After this also, in the yeare 1125. a cardinall named Johannes Cremensis
<span class="rightnote">Johannes Cremensis a legat sent into England.</span>
was sent into England from pope Honorius the second, to s&eacute;e reformation
in certeine points touching the church: but his cheefe errand was to
correct preests that still kept their wiues with them. At his first
comming ouer he soiourned in colledges of cathedrall churches, and in
abbeies, addicting himselfe to lucre &amp; wantonnesse, reaping where he had
not sowen. At length, about the feast of the natiuitie of our ladie, he
called a conuocation of the cleargie at London, where making an oration,
he inueihed sore against those of the spiritualtie that were spotted
with any note of incontinencie. Manie thought themselues touched with
his words, who hauing smelled somewhat of his secret tricks, that
whereas he was a most licentious liuer, and an vnchast person of bodie
and mind, vet he was so blinded, that he could not perceiue the beame in
his own eies, whilest he espied a mote in another mans. Herevpon they
grudged, that he should in such wise call other men to accompts for
their honest demeanor of life, which could not render any good reckoning
of his owne: insomuch that they watched him so narrowlie, that in the
euening (after he had blown his horne so lowd against other men; in
declaring that it was a shamefull vice to rise from the side of a
strumpet, and presume to sacrifice the bodie of Christ) he was taken in
bed with a strumpet, to his owne shame and reproch. But being reprooued
<span class="rightnote">But this shuld not s&eacute;em to be any iust excuse, for <i>M.P.</i>
saith that the same day he consecrated the Lords bodie, &amp; therefore he
must n&eacute;eds be a pr&eacute;est.</span>
thereof, he alledged this excuse (as some write) that he was no preest,
but a reformer of preests. Howbeit to conclude, being thus defamed, he
got him backe to Rome againe from whence he came, without any
performance of that whereabout he was sent.</p>

<p>But to returne to king Henrie, who whilest he remained in Normandie
(which was a long time after the apprehension of the two foresaid
earles) vnderstood that his sonne in lawe Henrie the emperour was
<span class="yearnote">1126. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;27.</span>
departed this life at Utregt, the 23. of Maie last past. Wherevpon he
sent for his daughter the empresse to come ouer vnto him into Normandie,
and hauing set his businesse in order on that side the sea, and taken
hir with him, he returned into England before the feast of S. Michaell,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> An oth taken by the lords touching the succession
of the crowne.</span>
where calling a parlement, he caused hir by the authoritie of the same
to be established as his lawfull heire and successor, with an article of
intaile vpon hir issue, if it should please God to send hir any at all.
At this parlement was Dauid K. of Scotland, who succ&eacute;eded Alexander the
fierce. Stephan earle of Morton and Bullongne, and son of Stephan earle
of Blois, nephue to K. Henrie by his sister Adela; these two princes
ch&eacute;efelie tooke their oth amongst other, to obey the foresaid empresse,
as touching hir right and lawfull claime to the crowne of England. But
<span class="rightnote">Stephan erle of Bullongne the first that offered to receiue
the oth.</span>
although Stephan was now the first that was to sweare, he became
shortlie after the first that brake that oth for his owne preferment. &para;
Thus it commeth often to passe, that those which receiue the greatest
benefits, doo oftentimes soonest forget to be thankefull.</p>

<p><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" ></a><span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
This Stephan latelie before by his vncle K. Henries meanes, had
purchased &amp; got in marriage the onelie daughter and heire of Eustace
earle of Bullongne, and so after the decease of his father in lawe,
became earle there: and further, had goodlie possessions in England
giuen him by the king, and yet (as farther shall appeare) he kept not
his oth made with K. Henrie. Some write that there rose no small strife
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i></span>
betwixt this earle Stephan, &amp; Robert erle of Glocester, in contending
which of them should first receiue this oth: the one alledging that he
was a kings sonne, and the other affirming that he was a kings nephue.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1127.</span>
Shortlie after this parlement was ended, K. Henrie held his Christmas at
Windsor, where Thurstan archbishop of Yorke (in preiudice of the right
of William archbishop of Canturburie) would haue set the crowne vpon the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
kings head, at his going to the church: but he was put backe with no
small reproch; and his chapleine (whom he appointed<a name="FNanchor_3_15" id="FNanchor_3_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> to beare his crosse
<span class="rightnote">Strife betwixt the prelates for preheminence.</span>
before him at his entrance into the kings chappell) was contemptuouslie
and violentlie thrust out of the doores with crosse and all by the
fr&eacute;ends of the archbishop of Canturburie. In short time, this vnseemlie
contention betwixt Thurstan and William the two archbishops grew so hot
that not onelie both of them, but also the bishop of Lincolne went to
Rome about the deciding of their strife.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
In this yeare Charles earle of Flanders, the successor of earle Baldwin,
was traitorouslie murthered of his owne people: &amp; bicause he left no
issue behind him to succ&eacute;ed as his heire, Lewes the French king made
William the sonne of duke Robert Curthose earle of Flanders, as the next
<span class="rightnote">William sonne to Robert Curthose made erle of Flanders</span>
cousine in bloud to the same Charles. &para;&nbsp;Truth it is, that by his fathers
side, this William was descended from erle Baldwin surnamed Pius, whose
daughter Maud being maried vnto William Conqueror, bare by him the
aforesaid Robert Curthose, father to this William now aduanced to the
gouernment of Flanders, but he wanted not aduersaries that were
competitors and malignant sutors for that earledome, who sought to
preferre themselues, and to displace him.</p>

<p>King Henrie misliking the promotion of the said William, although he was
his nephue, for that he supposed he would seeke to reuenge old
displeasures if he might compasse to haue the French kings assistance,
thought good with the aduice of his councell to withstand the worst.
Wherevpon he tooke order for the maintenance of the warre abroad, and
the supplie of souldiers, and other things necessarie to be considered
of for the suretie of his realme.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The empresse Maud married to the earle of Aniou. <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
After this, bicause he was in dispaire to haue issue by his second wife,
about Whitsuntide he sent ouer his daughter Maud the empresse into
Normandie, that she might be married vnto Geffrey Plantagenet earle of
Aniou, and in August after he followed himselfe. Now the matter went so
forward, that the mariage was celebrated betwixt the said earle and
empresse vpon the first sundaie in Aprill, which fell vpon the third of
the moneth, and in the 27. of his reigne.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;28.</span>
In the yeare ensuing, king Henrie meaning to cause the French king to
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
withdrawe his helping hand from his nephue William earle of Flanders,
passed foorth of Normandie with an armie, and inuading France, remained
<span class="yearnote">1128.</span>
for the space of eight daies at Hipard, in as good quiet as if he had
b&eacute;ene within his owne dominions, and finallie obteined that of the
French king which he sought for; namelie, his refusall to aid his nephue
the said earle of Flanders. Who at length contending with other that
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;29.</span>
claimed the earldome, chanced this yeare to be wounded, as he pursued
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ia.&nbsp;Meir.</i></span>
his enimies vnto the walls of a towne called Albust, and soone after
died of the hurt the 16. of August.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;It was thought that the great felicitie of king Henrie was the chiefe
<span class="rightnote">William earle of Flanders deceaseth of a wound.</span>
occasion of this earles death, who meant (if he might haue brought his
purpose to passe, and be once quietlie set in the dominion of Flanders)
to haue attempted some great enterprise against king Henrie for the
<span class="rightnote">The fortunat &amp; good hap of K. Henrie.</span>
recouerie of Normandie, and deliuerie of his father out of prison. Which
was knowen well inough to king Henrie, who mainteined those that made
him
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" ></a><span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
warre at home, both with men and monie; namelie, William of Hypres,
<span class="rightnote">William de Hypres.</span>
who tooke vpon him as regent in the name of Stephan earle of Bullongne,
whome king Henrie procured to make claime to Flanders also, in the title
of his grandmother queene Maud, wife to William Conqueror. But to
proc&eacute;ed with our historie.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1129. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;30.</span>
When king Henrie had sped his businesse in Normandie, where he had
remained a certeine space, both about the conclusion and solemnizing of
the mariage made betwixt his daughter Maud the empresse and the earle of
Aniou, and also to see the end of the wars in Flanders, he now returned
into England, where he called a great councell or parlement at London,
<span class="yearnote">1130. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;31.</span>
in August: wherein (amongst other things) it was decreed, that pr&eacute;ests,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Polydor.</i> An act against vnchast pr&eacute;ests.</span>
which liued vnchastlie, should be punished, and that by the kings
permission, who hereby tooke occasion to serue his owne turne: for he
regarded not the reformation which the bishops trusted (by his plaine
dealing) would haue followed, but put those pr&eacute;ests to their fines that
were accused, and suffered them to k&eacute;epe their wiues still in house with
them, which offended the bishops greatlie, who would haue had them
sequestred asunder.</p>

<p>After this parlement ended, the king kept his Christmasse at Worcester,
and his Eastermasse following at Woodstocke, where a certeine noble man
named Geffrey Clinton was accused to him of high treason. In this 31.
yeare of king Henries reigne, great death and murren of cattell began in
this land so vniuersallie in all places, that no towne nor village
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> In nouella historia. <i>Polydor.</i></span>
escaped fr&eacute;e: and long it was before the same discontinued or ceased.
King Henrie passing ouer into Normandie, was troubled with certeine
strange dreames or visitations in his sl&eacute;epe. For as he thought, he saw
a multitude of ploughmen with such tooles as belong to their trade and
occupation; after whom came a sort of souldiers with warlike weapons:
and last of all, bishops approching towards him with their crosier
staues readie to fall vpon him, as if they meant to kill him. Now when
he awaked, he lept foorth of his bed, got his sword in his hand, &amp;
called his seruants to come &amp; helpe him. Neuerthelesse, repressing those
perturbations, and somewhat better aduising himselfe, partlie by his
owne reason and partlie by the counsell of learned gentlemen, was
persuaded to put such fantasies awaie, and was admonished withall, that
whilest he had time and space here on earth, he should redeeme his
passed offenses and sinnes committed against God, with repentance,
almesd&eacute;eds, and abstinence. Wherefore being moued herewith, he began to
practise an amendment of his former lewd life.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Here it shall not be amisse to compare the two sonnes of William the
Conquerour; namelie William Rufus, and Henrie Beauclerke togither; and
to consider among other euents the supernaturall dreames wherewith they
were admonished, to excellent good purpose (no doubt) if they could haue
applied them to the end whereto they were directed. For William Rufus
(as you shall read in pag. 44.<a name="FNanchor_3_16" id="FNanchor_3_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>)
neglecting to be admonished by a
dredfull dreame wherewith he was troubled, shortlie after receiued his
deaths wound by casualtie or chancemedlie, euen in the prime of his
pastime and disport. This other brother H. Beauclerke had the like
warnings by the same meanes, and (to a good effect) as the learned doo
gather. Their rash opinion therefore is much to be checked, which
contemne dreames as meere delusorie, alledging by waie of disproofe an
old erronious verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Somnia ne cures, nam fallunt plurima plures,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Speaking indefinitelie of dreames without distinction: whereas in truth
great valure is in them in respect of their kind and nature. For though
some sort of dreames (as those that be physicall) are not greatlie to be
relied vpon; yet those of the metaphysicall sort hauing a speciall
influence from aboue natures reach, are not lightlie to be ouerslipped.
To determine this matter I remit the studious readers to that excellent
chapter of Peter Martyr, in the first part of his common places, pag.
32. columne 2. where dreames In genere are copiouslie handled.</p>

<p><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" ></a><span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
About the same time, Maud daughter of this Henrie, being forsaken of hir
husband Geffrey earle of Aniou, came to hir father then being in
Normandie. What the cause was why hir husband put hir from him, is not
certeinlie knowen: but the matter (belike) was not verie great, sith
shortlie after he receiued hir againe, and that of his owne accord.
During the time also king Henrie remained in Normandie, pope Innocent
the 2. came into France, to auoid the danger of his enimies: and holding
<span class="yearnote">1131. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;32.</span>
a councell at Cleremont, he accursed one Peter Fitz Leo, who had vsurped
as pope, and named himselfe Anacletus. Afterward at breaking vp of the
same counsell at Cleremont, he came to Orleance, and then to Charters,
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie and pope Innocent m&eacute;et at Charters.</span>
meeting king Henrie by the waie, who offered vnto the pope to mainteine
his cause against his enimies to the vttermost of his power, for the
which the pope gaue the king great thankes: and s&eacute;emed as though he had
beene more carefull for the defense of the common cause of the christian
common-wealth than for his owne, he exhorted king Henrie to make a
iournie into the holie land, against the Saracens and enimies of the
christian religion.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i></span>
In this enteruiew betwixt the pope and the king, the Romans were mooued
to maruell greatlie at the wisedome and sharpnesse of wit which they
perceiued in the Normans. For king Henrie, to shew what learning
remained amongst the people of the west parts of Europe, caused the
<span class="rightnote">The sons of Robert erle of Melent praised for their
learning.</span>
sonnes of Robert earle of Melent to argue and dispute in the points and
subtill sophismes of Logike, with the cardinals and other learned
chapleins of the pope there present, who were not ashamed to confesse,
that there was more learning amongst them here in the west parts, than
euer they heard or knew of in their owne countrie of Italy.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie returneth into England.</span>
King Henrie after this returned into England, and vpon the sea was in
danger to haue drowned by tempest: so that iudging the same to be as a
warning for him to amend his life, he made manie vowes, and after his
landing went to S. Edmundsburie in Suffolke to doo his deuotions vnto
the sepulchre of that king. Now at his comming from thence, being well
disposed, towards the reliefe of his people, he lessened the tributes
and impositions, and did iustice aswell in respect and fauour of the
poore as of the rich.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1132. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;33</span>
Not long after, Geffrey earle of Aniou had a son named Henrie by his
wife the empresse, who (as before is said) was after king of England:
for his grandfather king Henrie hauing no issue male to succeed him,
caused the empresse and this Henrie hir sonne to be established heires
of the realme: all the Nobles and other estates taking an oth to be
their true and loiall subiects. After this king Henrie kept his
<span class="yearnote">1133. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;34.</span>
Christmasse at Dunstable, and his Easter at Woodstocke. In the same
yeare, or (as some haue) in the beginning of the yeare precedent, or (as
other haue) in the yeare following, king Henrie erected a bishops s&eacute;e at
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> Prior of L. Oswald as <i>Wil.&nbsp;Thorne.</i> hath,
and likewise <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> and <i>Matt.&nbsp;Westm.</i></span>
Carleil, in which one Arnulfe or rather Athelwoolfe, who before was
abbat of S. Bothoulfs, and the kings confessor, was the first bishop
that was instituted there. This man immediatelie after his consecration
placed regular canons in that church.</p>

<p>Not long after, or rather before (as by Wil. Malmes. it should s&eacute;eme)
king Henrie passed ouer into Normandie, from whence (this being the last
time of his going thither) he neuer returned aliue. And as it came to
passe, he tooke ship to saile this last iournie thither, euen the same
daie in which he had afore time receiued the crowne. On which daie
<span class="rightnote">An eclipse<a name="FNanchor_3_17" id="FNanchor_3_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</span>
(felling vpon the Wednesdaie and being the second of August) a
wonderfull and extraordinarie eclipse of the sunne and moone appeared,
in somuch that Wil. Malmes. who then liued, writeth that he saw the
starres plainlie about the sunne at the verie time of that eclipse. On
the fridaie after such an earthquake also happened in this realme, that
<span class="rightnote">An earthquake.</span>
manie houses and buildings were ouerthrowne. This earthquake was so
sensible, or rather so visible, that the wall of the house wherein the
king then sat was lift vp with a double remoue, at the third it setled
it selfe againe in his due
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" ></a><span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
place. Moreouer at the verie same time also
fire burst out of certeine riffes of the earth in so huge flames, that
neither by water nor otherwise it could be quenched.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i></span>
In the 34. yeare of his reigne, his brother Robert Curthose departed
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;35.</span>
this life in the castell of Cardiff. It is said that on a festiuall daie
king Henrie put on a robe of scarlet, the cape whereof being streict, he
rent it in striuing to put it ouer his head: and perceiuing it would not
serue him, he laid it aside, and said; "Let my brother Robert haue this
robe, who hath a sharper head than I haue." Which when it was brought to
duke Robert, and the rent place not sowed vp, he perceiued it, and asked
whether any man had worne it before. The messenger told the whole matter
how it happened. Wherewith duke Robert tooke such a greefe for the
<span class="rightnote">The deceasse of Robert Curthose.</span>
scornefull mocke of his brother, that he waxed wearie of his life, and
said: "Now I perceiue I haue liued too long, that my brother shall cloth
me like his almes man with his cast and rent garments." Thus cursing the
time of his natiuitie, he refused from thencefoorth to eat or drinke,
and so pined awaie, and was buried at Glocester.</p>

<p>King Henrie remaining still in Normandie, rode round about a great part
of the countrie, shewing no small loue and courtesie to the people,
studieng by all meanes possible to win their fauours, and being merie
amongst them. Howbeit nothing reioised him more than that his daughter
Maud the empresse at the same time was deliuered of hir second sonne
named Geffrey, so that he saw himselfe prouided of an assured successor.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
But whilest he thus passed the time in mirth and solace, he began soone
<span class="yearnote">1135. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;35.</span>
after to be somewhat diseased, and neuer could perceiue any euident
cause thereof. Wherefore to driue his greefe away, he went abrode to
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i> <i>Sim.&nbsp;Dunel.</i></span>
hunt, and being somewhat amended thereby (as he thought) at his comming
home he would n&eacute;eds eat of a lampry, though his physician counselled him
to the contrarie: but he delighting most in the meat (though it be in
qualitie verie hurtfull to health) would not be dissuaded from it, so
that his stomach being annoied therewith he fell immediatelie into an
ague, and so died shortlie after, on the first day of December being as
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie departeth this life.</span>
then about 67. yeares of age after he had reigned 35. yeres, and foure
moneths lacking foure daies. His bodie was conueied into England, and
buried at Reading within the abbey church which he had founded, and
endowed in his life time with great and large possessions. It is
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i> <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i> <i>Sim.&nbsp;Dunel.</i></span>
written, that his bodie, to auoid the stench which had infected manie
men, was closed in a buls hide, and how he that clensed the head died of
the sauour which issued out of the braine.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Thus we s&eacute;e that euen princes come to the like end by as base meanes
as other inferiour persons; according to that of the poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="rightnote">Horat. lib. car. 1. ode. 28.</span>
<span class="i0">Dant alios furi&aelig; toruo spectacula Marti,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Exitio est auidis mare nautis:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mista senum ac iuuenum densantur funera, nullum<br /></span>
<span class="i1">S&aelig;ua caput Proserpina fugit.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And here we haue to note the neglect of the physicians counsell, and
that same ill disposition in diet which the king chose rather to
satisfie, than by restraining it to auoid the danger whereinto he fell.
But this is the preposterous election of vntoward patients, according to
that:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupim&uacute;sq; negata.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The issue of king Henrie the first.</span>
Touching his issue, he had by his first wife a sonne named William,
drowned (as ye haue heard) in the sea: also a daughter named Maud, whome
with hir sonnes he appointed to inherit his crowne and other dominions.
He had issue also by one of his concubins, euen a sonne named Richard,
and a daughter named Marie, who were both drowned with their brother
William. By an other concubine he had a sonne named Robert, who was
created duke of Glocester.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">His stature.</span>
He was strong of bodie, flehise, and of an indifferent stature, blacke
of haire, and in
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" ></a><span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
maner bald before, with great and large eies, of face
comelie, well countenanced, and pleasant to the beholders, speciallie
when he was disposed to mirth.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">His vertues.</span>
He excelled in three vertues, wisedome, eloquence, and valiancie, which
notwithstanding were somewhat blemished with the like number of vices
<span class="rightnote">His vices.</span>
that reigned in him; as couetousnesse, crueltie, and fleshlie lust of
bodie. His couetousnesse appeared, in that he sore oppressed his
subiects with tributes and impositions. His crueltie, in that he kept
his brother Robert Curtehose in perpetuall prison, and likewise in the
hard vsing of his cousine Robert earle of Mortaigne, whome he not onelie
deteined in prison, but also caused his eies to be put out: which act
was kept secret till the kings death reuealed it. And his fleshlie lust
was manifest, by k&eacute;eping of sundrie women.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">His wisdome.</span>
But in his other affaires he was circumspect, in defending his owne
verie earnest and diligent. Such wars as might be auoided, with
honourable peace he euer sought to appease; but when such iniuries were
offered as he thought not meet to suffer, he was an impatient reuenger
<span class="rightnote">His manlie courage.</span>
of the same, ouercomming all perils with the force of vertue and manlie
courage, showing himselfe either a most louing fr&eacute;end, or an extreame
enimie: for he would subdue his foes to the vttermost, and aduance his
fr&eacute;ends aboue measure.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">His zeale to iustice.</span>
With iustice he ruled the commons quietlie, and enterteined the nobles
honorablie. Th&eacute;eues, counterfeiters of monie, and other transgressors he
caused to be sought out with great diligence, and when they were found,
to be punished with great seueritie. Neither did he neglect reformations
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> Th&eacute;eues appointed to be hanged.</span>
of certeine naughtie abuses. And (as one author hath written) he
ordeined that th&eacute;eues should suffer death by hanging. When he heard that
such peeces of monie as were cracked would not be receiued amongest the
people, although the same were good and fine siluer, he caused all the
coine in the realme to be either broken or slit. He was sober of diet,
vsed to eat rather for the quailing of hunger, than to pamper himselfe
with manie daintie sorts of banketting dishes. He neuer dranke but when
thirst mooued him, he would sl&eacute;epe soundlie and snore oftentimes till he
<span class="rightnote">His policie.</span>
awaked therewith. He pursued his warres rather by policie than by the
sword, and ouercame his enimies so neere as he could without bloudshed,
which if it might not be, yet with as little slaughter as was possible.
<span class="rightnote">His praise for his princelie government.</span>
To conclude, he was not inferiour to any of the kings that reigned in
those daies, in wisedome and policie, and so behaued himselfe, that he
was honoured of the Nobles, and beloued of the commons. He builded
<span class="rightnote">Reading abbey builded.</span>
diuerse abbeies both in England and Normandie, but Reading was the
ch&eacute;efe. He builded the manour of Woodstocke, with the parke there,
wherein (beside the great store of deere) he appointed diuerse strange
beasts to be kept and nourished, which were brought and sent vnto him
from foreign countries farre distant, as lions, lepards, lynxes, and
porcupines. His estimation was such among outlandish princes, that few
would willinglie offend him.</p>

<span class="rightnote">Murcherdach K. of Ireland.</span>
Murcherdach king of Ireland &amp; his successors had him in such reuerence,
that they durst doo nothing but what he commanded, nor write any thing
but what might stand with his pleasure, though at the first the same
Morchad attempted something against the Englishmen more than held with
reason, but afterward (vpon restraint of the entercourse of merchandize)
he was glad to shew himselfe more fr&eacute;endlie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Orkney.</span>
Moreouer the earle of Orkney, although he was the king of Norwaies
subiect, yet did he what he could to procure king Henries fr&eacute;endship,
sending such strange beasts and other things to him oftentimes as
presents, wherein he knew the king tooke great delight and pleasure. He
<span class="rightnote">Roger bishop of Salisburie.</span>
had in singular fauour aboue all other of his councell, Roger, the
bishop of Salisburie, a politike prelate, and one that knew how to order
matters of great importance, vnto whome he committed the gouernment of
the realme most commonlie whilest he remained in Normandie.</p>

<p>As well in this kings daies, as in the time of his brother William
Rufus, men forgetting their owne sex and state, transformed themselues
<span class="rightnote">The abuse of wearing long haire.</span>
into the habit and forme of women, by suffering their haire to grow in
length, the which they curled and trimmed verie curiouslie, after the
maner of damosels and yong gentlewomen: insomuch that they made such
account of their long bushing perukes, that those which would be taken
for courtiers, contended with women who should haue the longest tresses,
and such as wanted, sought to amend it with art, and by knitting
wreathes about their heads of those their long and side locks for a
<span class="yearnote">1127.</span>
brauerie. Yet we read that king Henrie gaue commandment to all his
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i></span>
people to cut their haire, about the 28. yeare of his reigne. Preachers
indeed inueied against such vnseemlie maners in men, as a thing more
agr&eacute;eable and seemelie for the contrarie sex.</p>

<p>Wil. Malm. reciteth a tale of a knight in those daies that tooke no
small liking of himselfe for his faire and long haire, who chanced to
haue a verie terrible dreame. For it s&eacute;emed to him in his sl&eacute;epe that
one was about to strangle him with his owne haire (which<a name="FNanchor_3_18" id="FNanchor_3_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> he wrapped
about his throte and necke) the impression whereof sanke so deepelie
into his mind, that when he awaked out of his sl&eacute;epe, he streightwaies
caused so much of his haire to be cut as might seeme superfluous. A
great number of other in the realme followed his commendable example,
but the remorse of conscience herein that thus caused them to cut their
haire, continued not long, for they fell to the like abuse againe, so as
within a twelue moneths space they exc&eacute;eded therein as farre beyond all
the bounds of s&eacute;emelie order as before.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;In this Henrie ended the line of the Normans as touching the heires
male, and then came in the Frenchmen by the title of the heires
generall, after that the Normans had reigned about 69. yeares: for so
manie are accounted from the comming of William Conquerour, vnto the
beginning of the reigne of king Stephan, who succ&eacute;eded the said Henrie.</p>

<p class="lastline">Thus farr the succession and regiment of the Normans; namelie,
William Conquerour the father, William Rufus, and Henrie Beauclerke
the sonnes.</p>
